1 ||| generates an enormous feeling of empathy for its characters . 
1 ||| despite its many infuriating flaws -- not the least of which is amy's self-absorbed personality -- amy's o's honesty will win you over . 
1 ||| b�art and berling are both superb , while huppert . . . is magnificent . 
1 ||| woven together handsomely , recalling sixties' rockumentary milestones from lonely boy to don't look back . 
0 ||| a smug and convoluted action-comedy that doesn't allow an earnest moment to pass without reminding audiences that it's only a movie . 
1 ||| invincible is a wonderful movie . 
1 ||| the thing about guys like evans is this : you're never quite sure where self-promotion ends and the truth begins . but as you watch the movie , you're too interested to care . 
1 ||| the movie is one of the best examples of artful large format filmmaking you are likely to see anytime soon . 
1 ||| this is a film that manages to find greatness in the hue of its drastic iconography . 
0 ||| there ain't a lot more painful than an unfunny movie that thinks it's hilarious . 
0 ||| shows moments of promise but ultimately succumbs to cliches and pat storytelling . 
0 ||| [plays] in broad outline as pandering middle-age buddy-comedy . 
1 ||| a very capable nailbiter . 
1 ||| if no one singles out any of these performances as award-worthy , it's only because we would expect nothing less from this bunch . 
0 ||| resident evil isn't a product of its cinematic predecessors so much as an mtv , sugar hysteria , and playstation cocktail . 
0 ||| one of the most depressing movie-going experiences i can think of is to sit through about 90 minutes of a so-called 'comedy' and not laugh once . 
0 ||| it's dull , spiritless , silly and monotonous : an ultra-loud blast of pointless mayhem , going nowhere fast . 
1 ||| the complex , politically charged tapestry of contemporary chinese life this exciting new filmmaker has brought to the screen is like nothing we westerners have seen before . 
0 ||| the sort of movie that gives tastelessness a bad rap . 
1 |||  . . . plenty of warmth to go around , with music and laughter and the love of family . 
1 ||| if you grew up on scooby -- you'll love this movie . matthew lillard is born to play shaggy ! 
1 ||| harsh , effective documentary on life in the israeli-occupied palestinian territories . 
0 ||| the film is directed by wally wolodarsky from a script by joe jarvis and greg coolidge . these are names to remember , in order to avoid them in the future . 
1 ||| insomnia loses points when it surrenders to a formulaic bang-bang , shoot-em-up scene at the conclusion . but the performances of pacino , williams , and swank keep the viewer wide-awake all the way through . 
1 ||| a rich tale of our times , very well told with an appropriate minimum of means . 
0 ||| if this movie belonged to a sorority , it would be called beta alpha delta . 
0 ||| the film affords us intriguing glimpses of the insights gleaned from a lifetime of spiritual inquiry , but ram dass : fierce grace doesn't organize it with any particular insight . 
1 ||| the film serves as a valuable time capsule to remind us of the devastating horror suffered by an entire people . 
1 ||| a genuinely funny ensemble comedy that also asks its audience -- in a heartwarming , nonjudgmental kind of way -- to consider what we value in our daily lives . 
1 ||| y tu mam� tambi�n is hilariously , gloriously alive , and quite often hotter than georgia asphalt . 
0 ||| truth to tell , if you've seen more than half-a-dozen horror films , there's nothing here you haven't seen before . 
0 ||| it winds up moving in many directions as it searches ( vainly , i think ) for something fresh to say . 
0 ||| it's absolutely amazing how first-time director kevin donovan managed to find something new to add to the canon of chan . make chan's action sequences boring . 
0 ||| it all seemed wasted like deniro's once promising career and the once grand long beach boardwalk . 
1 ||| it's a square , sentimental drama that satisfies , as comfort food often can . 
1 ||| a compelling film . 
1 ||| hey , happy ! is many things -- stoner midnight flick , sci-fi deconstruction , gay fantasia -- but above all it's a love story as sanguine as its title . 
1 ||| the movie is amateurish , but it's a minor treat . 
0 ||| it made me want to wrench my eyes out of my head and toss them at the screen . 
1 ||| a giggle-inducing comedy with snappy dialogue and winning performances by an unlikely team of oscar-winners : susan sarandon and goldie hawn . 
1 ||| while somewhat less than it might have been , the film is a good one , and you've got to hand it to director george clooney for biting off such a big job the first time out . 
0 ||| the comedy death to smoochy is a rancorous curiosity : a movie without an apparent audience . 
1 ||| vera has created a provocative , absorbing drama that reveals the curse of a self-hatred instilled by rigid social mores . 
1 ||| the chateau belongs to rudd , whose portrait of a therapy-dependent flakeball spouting french malapropisms . . . is a nonstop hoot . 
1 ||| a sly dissection of the inanities of the contemporary music business and a rather sad story of the difficulties of artistic collaboration . 
1 ||| you'll gasp appalled and laugh outraged and possibly , watching the spectacle of a promising young lad treading desperately in a nasty sea , shed an errant tear . 
1 ||| a thought-provoking picture . 
0 ||| preposterous and tedious , sonny is spiked with unintentional laughter that , unfortunately , occurs too infrequently to make the film even a guilty pleasure . 
1 ||| campanella gets the tone just right -- funny in the middle of sad in the middle of hopeful . 
0 ||| in trying to be daring and original , it comes off as only occasionally satirical and never fresh . 
1 |||  . . . even if you've never heard of chaplin , you'll still be glued to the screen . 
0 ||| both the crime story and the love story are unusual . but they don't fit well together and neither is well told . 
1 ||| vincent gallo is right at home in this french shocker playing his usual bad boy weirdo role . 
1 ||| ana is a vivid , vibrant individual and the movie's focus upon her makes it successful and accessible . 
1 ||| ice cube holds the film together with an engaging and warm performance . . . 
1 ||| while this has the making of melodrama , the filmmaker cuts against this natural grain , producing a work that's more interested in asking questions than in answering them . 
0 ||| no telegraphing is too obvious or simplistic for this movie . 
0 ||| message movie or an action-packed submarine spectacular ? alas , it's neither . 
0 ||| even horror fans will most likely not find what they're seeking with trouble every day ; the movie lacks both thrills and humor . 
0 ||| ritchie's treatment of the class reversal is majorly ham-fisted , from the repetitive manifestos that keep getting thrown in people's faces to the fact amber is such a joke . 
0 ||| the director's twitchy sketchbook style and adroit perspective shifts grow wearisome amid leaden pacing and indifferent craftsmanship ( most notably wretched sound design ) . 
0 ||| it's neither as sappy as big daddy nor as anarchic as happy gilmore or the waterboy , but it has its moments . 
1 ||| hugely accomplished slice of hitchcockian suspense . 
1 ||| bogdanovich taps deep into the hearst mystique , entertainingly reenacting a historic scandal . 
0 ||| often silly and gross but it's rarely as moronic as some campus gross-out films . 
0 ||| undercover brother doesn't go far enough . it's just a silly black genre spoof . 
1 ||| k 19 stays afloat as decent drama/action flick
0 ||| sadly , though many of the actors throw off a spark or two when they first appear , they can't generate enough heat in this cold vacuum of a comedy to start a reaction . 
0 ||| swiftly deteriorates into a terribly obvious melodrama and rough-hewn vanity project for lead actress andie macdowell . 
0 ||| a supernatural mystery that doesn't know whether it wants to be a suspenseful horror movie or a weepy melodrama . it ends up being neither , and fails at both endeavors . 
0 ||| it's bedeviled by labored writing and slack direction . 
0 ||| black-and-white and unrealistic . 
1 ||| among the year's most intriguing explorations of alientation . 
1 ||| [ferrera] has the charisma of a young woman who knows how to hold the screen . 
0 ||| eight legged freaks won't join the pantheon of great monster/science fiction flicks that we have come to love . . . 
0 ||| interesting and thoroughly unfaithful version of carmen
1 ||| the pitch must have read like a discarded house beautiful spread . 
1 |||  . . . rogers's mouth never stops shut about the war between the sexes and how to win the battle . 
0 ||| nothing but one relentlessly depressing situation after another for its entire running time , something that you could easily be dealing with right now in your lives . 
0 ||| the story and characters are nowhere near gripping enough . 
0 ||| no reason for anyone to invest their hard-earned bucks into a movie which obviously didn't invest much into itself either . 
0 ||| this thing is just garbage . 
1 ||| believes so fervently in humanity that it feels almost anachronistic , and it is too cute by half . but arriving at a particularly dark moment in history , it offers flickering reminders of the ties that bind us . 
0 ||| instead of trying to bust some blondes , [diggs] should be probing why a guy with his talent ended up in a movie this bad . 
0 ||| i didn't laugh at the ongoing efforts of cube , and his skinny buddy mike epps , to make like laurel and hardy 'n the hood . 
1 ||| one funny popcorn flick . 
0 ||| could the whole plan here have been to produce something that makes fatal attraction look like a classic by comparison ? that's the only sane rationale i can think of for swimfan's existence . 
0 ||| shows holmes has the screen presence to become a major-league leading lady , ( but ) the movie itself is an underachiever , a psychological mystery that takes its sweet time building to a climax that's scarcely a surprise by the time it arrives . 
1 ||| this is historical filmmaking without the balm of right-thinking ideology , either liberal or conservative . mr . scorsese's bravery and integrity in advancing this vision can hardly be underestimated . 
1 ||| the characters are complex and quirky , but entirely believable as the remarkable ensemble cast brings them to life . 
0 ||| too campy to work as straight drama and too violent and sordid to function as comedy , vulgar is , truly and thankfully , a one-of-a-kind work . 
1 ||| the story , once it gets rolling , is nothing short of a great one . 
1 ||| the actors are simply too good , and the story too intriguing , for technical flaws to get in the way . 
1 ||| a genuinely moving and wisely unsentimental drama . 
0 ||| what you end up getting is the vertical limit of surfing movies - memorable stunts with lots of downtime in between . 
0 ||| just one bad idea after another . 
0 ||| yes , 4ever is harmless in the extreme and it'll mute your kids for nearly 80 minutes , but why not just treat the little yard apes to the real deal and take them to spirited away ? 
0 ||| it's difficult to conceive of anyone who has reached puberty actually finding the characters in slackers or their antics amusing , let alone funny . 
1 ||| for the most part , the film does hold up pretty well . 
1 ||| the dragons are the real stars of reign of fire and you won't be disappointed . 
1 ||| has its share of arresting images . 
1 ||| if you can stomach the rough content , it's worth checking out for the performances alone . 
0 ||| it's a boom-box of a movie that might have been titled 'the loud and the ludicrous' . . . the pandering to a moviegoing audience dominated by young males is all too calculated . 
0 ||| made with no discernible craft and monstrously sanctimonious in dealing with childhood loss . 
1 ||| a pleasant piece of escapist entertainment . 
0 ||| what a great shame that such a talented director as chen kaige has chosen to make his english-language debut with a film so poorly plotted and scripted . 
0 ||| so bland and utterly forgettable that it might as well have been titled generic jennifer lopez romantic comedy . 
0 ||| if damon and affleck attempt another project greenlight , next time out they might try paying less attention to the miniseries and more attention to the film it is about . 
1 ||| the gags are often a stitch . 
1 ||| nicolas philibert observes life inside a one-room schoolhouse in northern france in his documentary to be and to have , easily one of the best films of the year . 
0 ||| literally nothing in the pool is new , but if you grew up on the stalker flicks of the 1980's this one should appease you for 90 minutes . 
1 |||  a buoyant romantic comedy about friendship , love , and the truth that we're all in this together . 
0 |||  " one look at a girl in tight pants and big tits and you turn stupid ? " um . . isn't that the basis for the entire plot ? 
1 ||| i don't know if frailty will turn bill paxton into an a-list director , but he can rest contentedly with the knowledge that he's made at least one damn fine horror movie . 
0 ||| she's not yet an actress , not quite a singer . . . 
0 ||| kitschy , flashy , overlong soap opera . 
0 ||| no amount of good acting is enough to save oleander's uninspired story . 
0 ||| a non-mystery mystery . 
0 ||| for all its surface frenzy , high crimes should be charged with loitering -- so much on view , so little to offer . 
0 ||| i could have used my two hours better watching being john malkovich again . 
0 ||| it's another video movie photographed like a film , with the bad lighting that's often written off as indie film naturalism . 
0 ||| why come up with something even quasi-original , when you can pillage from shirley jackson , richard matheson . . . and puke up something like rose red ? 
0 ||| the story is -- forgive me -- a little thin , and the filmmaking clumsy and rushed . 
1 ||| an effectively creepy , fear-inducing ( not fear-reducing ) film from japanese director hideo nakata , who takes the superstitious curse on chain letters and actually applies it . 
1 ||| the pianist [is] a supremely hopeful cautionary tale of war's madness remembered that we , today , can prevent its tragic waste of life . here is a divine monument to a single man's struggle to regain his life , his dignity and his music . 
1 ||| stock up on silver bullets for director neil marshall's intense freight train of a film . 
1 ||| kids should have a stirring time at this beautifully drawn movie . and adults will at least have a dream image of the west to savor whenever the film's lamer instincts are in the saddle . 
0 ||| no , it's not nearly as good as any of its influences . 
0 ||| one big blustery movie where nothing really happens . when it comes out on video , then it's the perfect cure for insomnia . 
0 ||| not counting a few gross-out comedies i've been trying to forget , this is the first film in a long time that made me want to bolt the theater in the first 10 minutes . 
0 ||| it may be an easy swipe to take , but this barbershop just doesn't make the cut . 
1 ||| a moving essay about the specter of death , especially suicide . 
1 ||| in a way , the film feels like a breath of fresh air , but only to those that allow it in . 
0 ||| there are now two signs that m . night shyamalan's debut feature sucked up all he has to give to the mystic genres of cinema : unbreakable and signs . 
1 ||| broomfield reminds us that beneath the hype , the celebrity , the high life , the conspiracies and the mystery there were once a couple of bright young men -- promising , talented , charismatic and tragically doomed . 
1 ||| it's not a classic spy-action or buddy movie , but it's entertaining enough and worth a look . 
1 ||| there's none of the happily-ever -after spangle of monsoon wedding in late marriage -- and that's part of what makes dover kosashvili's outstanding feature debut so potent . 
1 ||| perhaps the grossest movie ever made . funny , though . 
1 ||| if you thought tom hanks was just an ordinary big-screen star , wait until you've seen him eight stories tall . 
0 ||| some stunning visuals -- and some staggeringly boring cinema . 
1 ||| the bard as black comedy -- willie would have loved it . 
1 ||| a different and emotionally reserved type of survival story -- a film less about refracting all of world war ii through the specific conditions of one man , and more about that man lost in its midst . 
0 ||| though catch me if you can isn't badly made , the fun slowly leaks out of the movie . 
1 ||| [t]his beguiling belgian fable , very much its own droll and delicate little film , has some touching things to say about what is important in life and why . 
1 ||| the movie starts with a legend and ends with a story that is so far-fetched it would be impossible to believe if it weren't true . this is the stuff that disney movies are made of . 
0 ||| i'm just too bored to care . 
0 ||| there are some laughs in this movie , but williams' anarchy gets tiresome , the satire is weak . 
1 ||| sturdy , entertaining period drama . . . both caine and fraser have their moments . 
1 ||| it's an unusual , thoughtful bio-drama with a rich subject and some fantastic moments and scenes . 
0 ||| shyamalan should stop trying to please his mom . 
0 ||| john leguizamo may be a dramatic actor -- just not in this movie . 
1 ||| this new movie version of the alexandre dumas classic is the stuff of high romance , brought off with considerable wit . 
0 ||| ultimately , jane learns her place as a girl , softens up and loses some of the intensity that made her an interesting character to begin with . 
1 ||| plays out with a dogged and eventually winning squareness that would make it the darling of many a kids-and-family-oriented cable channel . 
1 ||| it shows us a slice of life that's very different from our own and yet instantly recognizable . 
0 ||| merchant hasn't directed this movie so much as produced it -- like sausage . 
0 ||| breen's script is sketchy with actorish notations on the margin of acting . 
1 ||| a few artsy flourishes aside , narc is as gritty as a movie gets these days . 
0 |||  . . . a bland , pretentious mess . 
0 ||| yet another entry in the sentimental oh-those-wacky-brits genre that was ushered in by the full monty and is still straining to produce another smash hit . 
0 ||| it's one pussy-ass world when even killer-thrillers revolve around group therapy sessions . 
0 ||| extremely bad . 
1 ||| as warm as it is wise , deftly setting off uproarious humor with an underlying seriousness that sneaks up on the viewer , providing an experience that is richer than anticipated . 
0 ||| an unintentional parody of every teen movie made in the last five years . 
1 ||| worth a look as a curiosity . 
1 ||| proves that some movie formulas don't need messing with -- like the big-bug movie . 
0 ||| where last time jokes flowed out of cho's life story , which provided an engrossing dramatic through line , here the comedian hides behind obviously constructed routines . 
0 ||| it's better than the phantom menace . but unless you're an absolute raving star wars junkie , it isn't much fun . 
1 ||| a bonanza of wacky sight gags , outlandish color schemes , and corny visual puns that can be appreciated equally as an abstract frank tashlin comedy and as a playful recapitulation of the artist's career . 
0 ||| adam sandler's heart may be in the right place , but he needs to pull his head out of his butt
0 ||| only about as sexy and dangerous as an actress in a role that reminds at every turn of elizabeth berkley's flopping dolphin-gasm . 
1 ||| about a boy vividly recalls the cary grant of room for one more , houseboat and father goose in its affectionate depiction of the gentle war between a reluctant , irresponsible man and the kid who latches onto him . 
0 ||| it's difficult to discern if this is a crazy work of disturbed genius or merely 90 minutes of post-adolescent electra rebellion . 
1 ||| though the aboriginal aspect lends the ending an extraordinary poignancy , and the story itself could be played out in any working class community in the nation . 
0 ||| more of a career curio than a major work . 
1 ||| frida's artistic brilliance is undeniable -- it's among the most breathtakingly designed films i've ever seen . 
1 ||| it's unnerving to see recoing's bizzarre reaction to his unemployment . good film , but very glum . 
1 |||  " mostly martha " is a bright , light modern day family parable that wears its heart on its sleeve for all to see . 
0 ||| every now and again , a movie comes along to remind us of how very bad a motion picture can truly be . frank mcklusky c . i . is that movie ! 
0 ||| i can only imagine one thing worse than kevin spacey trying on an irish accent , and that's sultry linda fiorentino doing the same thing . 
1 ||| the search for redemption makes for a touching love story , mainly because blanchett and ribisi compellingly tap into a spiritual aspect of their characters' suffering . 
1 ||| a minor work yet there's no denying the potency of miller's strange , fleeting brew of hopeful perseverance and hopeless closure . 
0 ||| when the precise nature of matthew's predicament finally comes into sharp focus , the revelation fails to justify the build-up . 
1 ||| the strength of the film comes not from any cinematic razzle-dazzle but from its recovery of an historical episode that , in the simple telling , proves simultaneously harrowing and uplifting . 
1 ||| an absorbing , slice-of-depression life that touches nerves and rings true . 
1 ||| jackson tries to keep the plates spinning as best he can , but all the bouncing back and forth can't help but become a bit tedious -- even with the breathtaking landscapes and villainous varmints there to distract you from the ricocheting . 
0 ||| ever see one of those comedies that just seem like a bad idea from frame one ? 
1 ||| there's absolutely no reason why blue crush , a late-summer surfer girl entry , should be as entertaining as it is
0 ||| there's a thin line between likably old-fashioned and fuddy-duddy , and the count of monte cristo . . . never quite settles on either side . 
0 ||| too clumsy in key moments . . . to make a big splash . 
0 ||| the story's so preposterous that i didn't believe it for a second , despite the best efforts of everyone involved . 
0 ||| maybe it's asking too much , but if a movie is truly going to inspire me , i want a little more than this . 
1 |||  . . . the story , like ravel's bolero , builds to a crescendo that encompasses many more paths than we started with . 
0 ||| too much of the movie feels contrived , as if the filmmakers were worried the story wouldn't work without all those gimmicks . 
0 ||| even if the enticing prospect of a lot of nubile young actors in a film about campus depravity didn't fade amid the deliberate , tiresome ugliness , it would be rendered tedious by avary's failure to construct a story with even a trace of dramatic interest . 
0 ||| an amateurish , quasi-improvised acting exercise shot on ugly digital video . 
0 ||| this bond film goes off the beaten path , not necessarily for the better . 
0 ||| this idea has lost its originality . . . and neither star appears very excited at rehashing what was basically a one-joke picture . 
1 ||| although occasionally static to the point of resembling a stage play , the film delivers a solid mixture of sweetness and laughs . 
0 ||| this ill-conceived and expensive project winds up looking like a bunch of talented thesps slumming it . 
1 ||| a lot more dimensional and complex than its sunny disposition would lead you to believe . 
0 ||| the first hour is tedious though ford and neeson capably hold our interest , but its just not a thrilling movie . 
1 ||| it's funny and human and really pretty damned wonderful , all at once . 
0 ||| such an incomprehensible mess that it feels less like bad cinema than like being stuck in a dark pit having a nightmare about bad cinema . 
1 ||| a hugely rewarding experience that's every bit as enlightening , insightful and entertaining as grant's two best films -- four weddings and a funeral and bridget jones's diary . 
0 ||| not good enough to pass for a litmus test of the generation gap and not bad enough to repulse any generation of its fans . 
1 ||| a meditation on faith and madness , frailty is blood-curdling stuff . 
1 ||| like a tarantino movie with heart , alias betty is richly detailed , deftly executed and utterly absorbing . 
0 ||| lacking substance and soul , crossroads comes up shorter than britney's cutoffs . 
0 ||| an uplifting , largely bogus story . 
1 ||| on the surface a silly comedy , scotland , pa would be forgettable if it weren't such a clever adaptation of the bard's tragic play . 
0 ||| replacing john carpenter's stylish tracking shots is degraded , handheld blair witch video-cam footage . of all the halloween's , this is the most visually unappealing . 
1 ||| rifkin's references are . . . impeccable throughout . 
1 ||| although some viewers will not be able to stomach so much tongue-in-cheek weirdness , those who do will have found a cult favorite to enjoy for a lifetime . 
0 ||| cassavetes thinks he's making dog day afternoon with a cause , but all he's done is to reduce everything he touches to a shrill , didactic cartoon . 
0 ||| the movie does such an excellent job of critiquing itself at every faltering half-step of its development that criticizing feels more like commiserating . 
1 ||| the saturation bombing of reggio's images and glass' evocative music . . . ultimately leaves viewers with the task of divining meaning . 
1 ||| jaunty fun , with its celeb-strewn backdrop well used . 
0 ||| there are deeply religious and spiritual people in this world who would argue that entering a church , synagogue or temple doesn't mean you have to check your brain at the door . the same should go for movie theaters . 
0 ||| though uniformly well acted , especially by young ballesta and galan ( a first-time actor ) , writer/director achero manas's film is schematic and obvious . 
0 ||| dull and mechanical , kinda like a very goofy museum exhibit
1 ||| the perfect film for those who like sick comedies that can be snide . 
0 ||| has not so much been written as assembled , frankenstein-like , out of other , marginally better shoot-em-ups . 
1 ||| farrell . . . thankfully manages to outshine the role and successfully plays the foil to willis's world-weary colonel . 
1 ||| warm water under a red bridge is a quirky and poignant japanese film that explores the fascinating connections between women , water , nature , and sexuality . 
0 ||| laconic and very stilted in its dialogue , this indie flick never found its audience , probably because it's extremely hard to relate to any of the characters . 
1 ||| i'd rather watch a rerun of the powerpuff girls
0 ||| a direct-to-void release , heading nowhere . 
1 ||| lookin' for sin , american-style ? try hell house , which documents the cautionary christian spook-a-rama of the same name . 
1 ||| this real-life hollywood fairy-tale is more engaging than the usual fantasies hollywood produces . 
0 ||| what madonna does here can't properly be called acting -- more accurately , it's moving and it's talking and it's occasionally gesturing , sometimes all at once . 
0 ||| an awkward hybrid of genres that just doesn't work . 
0 ||| 'lovely and amazing , ' unhappily , is neither . . . excessively strained and contrived . 
0 ||| like shave ice without the topping , this cinematic snow cone is as innocuous as it is flavorless . 
1 ||| the story . . . is inspiring , ironic , and revelatory of just how ridiculous and money-oriented the record industry really is . it is also a testament to the integrity and vision of the band . 
1 ||| spielberg has managed to marry science fiction with film noir and action flicks with philosophical inquiry . 
0 ||| meandering and confusing . 
0 ||| sensitive though not quite revelatory documentary . 
1 ||| though a touch too arthouse 101 in its poetic symbolism , heaven proves to be a good match of the sensibilities of two directors . 
0 ||| the story alone could force you to scratch a hole in your head . 
1 ||| it will make you think twice about what might be going on inside each trailer park you drive past -- even if it chiefly inspires you to drive a little faster . 
1 ||| strange and beautiful film . 
0 ||| the fight scenes are fun , but it grows tedious . 
1 |||  . . . fuses the events of her life with the imagery in her paintings so vividly that the artist's work may take on a striking new significance for anyone who sees the film . 
0 ||| despite engaging offbeat touches , knockaround guys rarely seems interested in kicking around a raison d'etre that's as fresh-faced as its young-guns cast . 
0 ||| the holiday message of the 37-minute santa vs . the snowman leaves a lot to be desired . 
0 ||| surprisingly , considering that baird is a former film editor , the movie is rather choppy . 
1 ||| a charming romantic comedy that is by far the lightest dogme film and among the most enjoyable . 
0 ||| there's not a fresh idea at the core of this tale . 
1 ||| maud and roland's search for an unknowable past makes for a haunting literary detective story , but labute pulls off a neater trick in possession : he makes language sexy . 
1 ||| ' . . . despite lagging near the finish line , the movie runs a good race , one that will have you at the edge of your seat for long stretches . '
1 ||| leave it to rohmer , now 82 , to find a way to bend current technique to the service of a vision of the past that is faithful to both architectural glories and commanding open spaces of the city as it was more than two centuries ago . 
0 ||| it's a pedestrian , flat drama that screams out 'amateur' in almost every frame . 
0 ||| if we're to slap protagonist genevieve leplouff because she's french , do we have that same option to slap her creators because they're clueless and inept ? 
0 ||| will no doubt delight plympton's legion of fans ; others may find 80 minutes of these shenanigans exhausting . 
0 ||| if the movie were all comedy , it might work better . but it has an ambition to say something about its subjects , but not a willingness . 
1 ||| what makes salton sea surprisingly engrossing is that caruso takes an atypically hypnotic approach to a world that's often handled in fast-edit , hopped-up fashion . 
0 ||| the problem is that for the most part , the film is deadly dull . 
1 ||| enormously entertaining for moviegoers of any age . 
1 ||| an intense and effective film about loneliness and the chilly anonymity of the environments where so many of us spend so much of our time . 
1 ||| with dickens' words and writer-director douglas mcgrath's even-toned direction , a ripping good yarn is told . 
1 ||| a must-see for the david mamet enthusiast and for anyone who appreciates intelligent , stylish moviemaking . 
0 ||| it's rare that a movie can be as intelligent as this one is in every regard except its storyline ; everything that's good is ultimately scuttled by a plot that's just too boring and obvious . 
0 ||| a fairly by-the-books blend of action and romance with sprinklings of intentional and unintentional comedy . 
0 ||| this is a throwaway , junk-food movie whose rap soundtrack was better tended to than the film itself . 
1 ||| there's no clear picture of who killed bob crane . but here's a glimpse at his life . 
0 ||| whether jason x is this bad on purpose is never clear . but one thing's for sure : it never comes close to being either funny or scary . 
1 ||| instead of a hyperbolic beat-charged urban western , it's an unpretentious , sociologically pointed slice of life . 
1 ||| it made me want to get made-up and go see this movie with my sisters . i thought the relationships were wonderful , the comedy was funny , and the love 'real' . 
1 ||| an exhilarating futuristic thriller-noir , minority report twists the best of technology around a gripping story , delivering a riveting , pulse intensifying escapist adventure of the first order
0 ||| puts on airs of a hal hartley wannabe film -- without the vital comic ingredient of the hilarious writer-director himself . 
0 ||| cry havoc and let slip the dogs of cheese , indeed . 
1 ||| exhilarating , funny and fun . 
0 ||| it appears to have been made by people to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept . 
1 ||| zhang . . . has done an amazing job of getting realistic performances from his mainly nonprofessional cast . 
1 ||| just about the best straight-up , old-school horror film of the last 15 years . 
0 ||| pascale bailly's rom-com provides am�lie's audrey tautou with another fabuleux destin -- i . e . , a banal spiritual quest . 
0 ||| not really a thriller so much as a movie for teens to laugh , groan and hiss at . 
1 ||| finally , a genre movie that delivers -- in a couple of genres , no less . 
0 ||| davis . . . is so enamored of her own creation that she can't see how insufferable the character is . 
1 ||| the film may not hit as hard as some of the better drug-related pictures , but it still manages to get a few punches in . 
0 ||| so clich�d that , at one point , they literally upset an apple cart . 
0 ||| a boring , pretentious muddle that uses a sensational , real-life 19th-century crime as a metaphor for -- well , i'm not exactly sure what -- and has all the dramatic weight of a raindrop . 
1 ||| the rich performances by friel -- and especially williams , an american actress who becomes fully english -- round out the square edges . 
1 ||| a movie that will surely be profane , politically charged music to the ears of cho's fans . 
1 ||| the pianist is a fine valedictory work for polanski , made richer by his own experiences , making his other movies somehow richer in the bargain . 
1 ||| it's the type of film about growing up that we don't see often enough these days : realistic , urgent , and not sugarcoated in the least . 
1 |||  . . . quite good at providing some good old fashioned spooks . 
0 ||| an uneven look into a grim future that doesn't come close to the level of intelligence and visual splendour that can be seen in other films based on philip k . dick stories . 
1 ||| like mike is a harmlessly na�ve slice of b-ball fantasy , fit for filling in during the real nba's off-season . 
0 ||| a clumsily manufactured exploitation flick , a style-free exercise in manipulation and mayhem . 
0 ||| plays like a volatile and overlong w magazine fashion spread . 
0 ||| predecessors the mummy and the mummy returns stand as intellectual masterpieces next to the scorpion king . 
1 ||| a sobering and powerful documentary about the most severe kind of personal loss : rejection by one's mother . 
0 ||| the overall feel of the film is pretty cheesy , but there's still a real sense that the star trek tradition has been honored as best it can , given the embarrassing script and weak direction . 
1 ||| the film is just a big , gorgeous , mind-blowing , breath-taking mess . 
0 ||| the film would work much better as a video installation in a museum , where viewers would be free to leave . immediately . 
0 ||| feels less like a cousin to blade runner than like a bottom-feeder sequel in the escape from new york series . 
0 ||| the drama discloses almost nothing . 
1 ||| the immersive powers of the giant screen and its hyper-realistic images are put to perfect use in the breathtakingly beautiful outer-space documentary space station 3d . 
1 ||| 'the film is stark , straightforward and deadly . . . an unnatural calm that's occasionally shaken by . . . blasts of rage , and later , violent jealousy . '
0 ||| that is essentially what's missing from blackboards -- the sense of something bigger , some ultimate point . 
1 ||| a warm , funny , engaging film . 
1 ||| even if you're an agnostic carnivore , you can enjoy much of jonah simply , and gratefully , as laugh-out-loud lunacy with a pronounced monty pythonesque flavor . 
1 ||| there's a disreputable air about the whole thing , and that's what makes it irresistible . 
1 ||| graphic sex may be what's attracting audiences to unfaithful , but gripping performances by lane and gere are what will keep them awake . 
1 ||| rarely does such high-profile talent serve such literate material . 
0 ||| dilbert without the right-on satiric humor . 
1 ||| a small movie with a big heart . 
0 ||| such a fine idea for a film , and such a stultifying , lifeless execution . 
1 ||| hollywood ending is not show-stoppingly hilarious , but scathingly witty nonetheless . 
1 ||| an unusually dry-eyed , even analytical approach to material that is generally played for maximum moisture . 
0 ||| it's frustrating to see these guys -- who are obviously pretty clever -- waste their talent on parodies of things they probably thought were funniest when they were high . 
0 ||| a by-the-numbers patient/doctor pic that covers all the usual ground
0 ||| to my taste , the film's comic characters come perilously close to being amoses and andys for a new generation . 
1 ||| a diverse and astonishingly articulate cast of palestinian and israeli children . 
1 ||| digital-video documentary about stand-up comedians is a great glimpse into a very different world . 
0 ||| a sequel that's much too big for its britches . 
1 ||| one of the funniest motion pictures of the year , but . . . also one of the most curiously depressing . 
1 ||| jae-eun jeong's take care of my cat brings a beguiling freshness to a coming-of-age story with such a buoyant , expressive flow of images that it emerges as another key contribution to the flowering of the south korean cinema . 
0 ||| [siegel] and co-writers lisa bazadona and grace woodard have relied too much on convention in creating the characters who surround frankie . 
0 ||| godard uses his characters -- if that's not too glorified a term -- as art things , mouthpieces , visual motifs , blanks . 
0 ||| it's almost as if it's an elaborate dare more than a full-blooded film . 
0 ||| the world needs more filmmakers with passionate enthusiasms like martin scorsese . but it doesn't need gangs of new york . 
0 ||| new best friend's playboy-mansion presentation of college life is laugh-out-loud ludicrous . 
0 ||| rumor , a muddled drama about coming to terms with death , feels impersonal , almost generic . 
0 ||| any movie this boring should be required to have ushers in the theater that hand you a cup of coffee every few minutes . like a marathon runner trying to finish a race , you need a constant influx of liquid just to get through it . 
0 ||| too close to phantom menace for comfort . 
1 ||| a yarn that respects the marvel version without becoming ensnared by it . 
0 ||| reggio falls victim to relying on the very digital technology that he fervently scorns , creating a meandering , inarticulate and ultimately disappointing film . 
0 ||| kwan makes the mix-and- match metaphors intriguing , while lulling us into torpor with his cultivated allergy to action . 
1 ||| visually fascinating . . . an often intense character study about fathers and sons , loyalty and duty . 
0 ||| we haven't seen such hilarity since say it isn't so ! 
1 ||| full frontal is the antidote for soderbergh fans who think he's gone too commercial since his two oscar nominated films in 2000
0 ||| a sour attempt at making a farrelly brothers-style , down-and-dirty laugher for the female set . 
1 ||| the film has an infectious enthusiasm and we're touched by the film's conviction that all life centered on that place , that time and that sport . 
1 ||| a mess when it comes to the characters and writing . . . but works its way underneath the skin like few movies have in recent memory . 
1 ||| a good music documentary , probably one of the best since the last waltz . 
0 ||| a stupid , derivative horror film that substitutes extreme gore for suspense . 
1 ||| one of those rare , exhilarating cinematic delights that gets even better in hindsight , as you mull over its every nuance in your mind . 
1 ||| a solid piece of journalistic work that draws a picture of a man for whom political expedience became a deadly foreign policy . 
1 ||| the film is painfully authentic , and the performances of the young players are utterly convincing . 
0 ||| the sweetest thing leaves an awful sour taste . 
1 ||| girls gone wild and gone civil again
0 ||| this is rote spookiness , with nary an original idea ( or role , or edit , or score , or anything , really ) in sight , and the whole of the proceedings beg the question 'why ? '
0 ||| with all the sympathy , empathy and pity fogging up the screen . . . his secret life enters the land of unintentional melodrama and tiresome love triangles . 
1 ||| a moving and solidly entertaining comedy/drama that should bolster director and co-writer juan jos� campanella's reputation in the united states . 
1 ||| elegant , mannered and teasing . 
1 ||| a compelling , gut-clutching piece of advocacy cinema that carries you along in a torrent of emotion as it explores the awful complications of one terrifying day . 
0 ||| a minor-league soccer remake of the longest yard . 
1 ||| ramsay , as in ratcatcher , remains a filmmaker with an acid viewpoint and a real gift for teasing chilly poetry out of lives and settings that might otherwise seem drab and sordid . 
1 ||| although it lacks the detail of the book , the film does pack some serious suspense . 
0 ||| this toothless dog , already on cable , loses all bite on the big screen . 
1 ||| a fine effort , an interesting topic , some intriguing characters and a sad ending . certainly the big finish wasn't something galinsky and hawley could have planned for . . . but part of being a good documentarian is being there when the rope snaps . 
0 ||| far too clever by half , howard's film is really a series of strung-together moments , with all the spaces in between filled with fantasies , daydreams , memories and one fantastic visual trope after another . 
1 ||| one of the greatest family-oriented , fantasy-adventure movies ever . 
0 ||| as inept as big-screen remakes of the avengers and the wild wild west . 
0 ||| the script becomes lifeless and falls apart like a cheap lawn chair . 
0 ||| a farce of a parody of a comedy of a premise , it isn't a comparison to reality so much as it is a commentary about our knowledge of films . 
0 ||| a fitfully amusing romp that , if nothing else , will appeal to fans of malcolm in the middle and its pubescent star , frankie muniz . 
0 ||| the smug , oily demeanor that donovan adopts throughout the stupidly named pipe dream is just repulsive . 
1 ||| this humbling little film , fueled by the light comedic work of zhao benshan and the delicate ways of dong jie , is just the sort for those moviegoers who complain that 'they don't make movies like they used to anymore . '
1 ||| proves mainly that south korean filmmakers can make undemanding action movies with all the alacrity of their hollywood counterparts . 
0 ||| the good girl is a film in which the talent is undeniable but the results are underwhelming . 
1 ||| steers , in his feature film debut , has created a brilliant motion picture . 
0 ||| the movie is dawn of the dead crossed with john carpenter's ghosts of mars , with zombies not as ghoulish as the first and trains not as big as the second . 
0 |||  . . . ( like ) channel surfing between the discovery channel and a late-night made-for-cable action movie . 
1 ||| a pleasant enough comedy that should have found a summer place . 
1 ||| it sends you away a believer again and quite cheered at just that . 
1 ||| the additional storyline is interesting and entertaining , but it doesn't have the same magical quality as the beginning of the story . i like the new footage and still love the old stuff . 
0 ||| you're too conscious of the effort it takes to be this spontaneous . 
0 ||| better at putting you to sleep than a sound machine . 
1 ||| makmalbaf follows a resolutely realistic path in this uncompromising insight into the harsh existence of the kurdish refugees of iran's borderlands . 
1 ||| a classy item by a legend who may have nothing left to prove but still has the chops and drive to show how its done . 
1 |||  . . . a good film that must have baffled the folks in the marketing department . 
0 ||| this film is so slick , superficial and trend-hoppy , that it's easy to imagine that a new software program spit out the screenplay . 
1 ||| manages to be wholesome and subversive at the same time . 
0 ||| as aimless as an old pickup skidding completely out of control on a long patch of black ice , the movie makes two hours feel like four . 
1 ||| it's enough to watch huppert scheming , with her small , intelligent eyes as steady as any noir villain , and to enjoy the perfectly pitched web of tension that chabrol spins . 
0 ||| starts off witty and sophisticated and you want to love it -- but filmmaker yvan attal quickly writes himself into a corner . 
1 ||| has the capability of effecting change and inspiring hope . 
0 ||| the movie quickly drags on becoming boring and predictable . i tried to read the time on my watch . 
1 ||| it has the courage to wonder about big questions with sincerity and devotion . it risks seeming slow and pretentious , because it thinks the gamble is worth the promise . 
0 ||| has all the right elements but completely fails to gel together . 
1 ||| allen se atreve a atacar , a atacarse y nos ofrece gags que van de la sonrisa a la risa de larga duraci�n
0 ||| director roger michell does so many of the little things right that it's difficult not to cuss him out severely for bungling the big stuff . 
0 ||| deuces wild is an encyclopedia of cliches that shoplifts shamelessly from farewell-to-innocence movies like the wanderers and a bronx tale without cribbing any of their intelligence . 
0 ||| a modest and messy metaphysical thriller offering more questions than answers . 
0 ||| bearable . barely . 
0 ||| the original wasn't a good movie but this remake makes it look like a masterpiece ! 
0 ||| the film never gets over its own investment in conventional arrangements , in terms of love , age , gender , race , and class . 
0 ||| the action here is unusually tame , the characters are too simplistic to maintain interest , and the plot offers few surprises . 
0 ||| the story is naturally poignant , but first-time screenwriter paul pender overloads it with sugary bits of business . 
1 ||| a witty , low-key romantic comedy . 
1 ||| it's quite diverting nonsense . 
0 ||| although bright , well-acted and thought-provoking , tuck everlasting suffers from a laconic pace and a lack of traditional action . 
1 ||| if you haven't seen the film lately , you may be surprised at the variety of tones in spielberg's work . much of it is funny , but there are also some startling , surrealistic moments . . . 
1 ||| [clooney's] debut can be accused of being a bit undisciplined , but it has a tremendous , offbeat sense of style and humor that suggests he was influenced by some of the filmmakers who have directed him , especially the coen brothers and steven soderbergh . 
0 ||| a well acted and well intentioned snoozer . 
1 ||| my big fat greek wedding is that rare animal known as 'a perfect family film , ' because it's about family . 
0 ||| a great idea becomes a not-great movie . 
0 ||| here's a self-congratulatory 3d imax rah-rah . 
0 ||| a cinematic sleeping pill of impressive potency . 
0 ||| not a movie but a live-action agitprop cartoon so shameless and coarse , it's almost funny . 
0 ||| feels haphazard , as if the writers mistakenly thought they could achieve an air of frantic spontaneity by simply tossing in lots of characters doing silly stuff and stirring the pot . 
1 ||| this ready-made midnight movie probably won't stand the cold light of day , but under the right conditions , it's goofy ( if not entirely wholesome ) fun . 
1 ||| his work transcends the boy-meets-girl posturing of typical love stories . 
1 ||| sometimes we feel as if the film careens from one colorful event to another without respite , but sometimes it must have seemed to frida kahlo as if her life did , too . 
1 ||| although olivier assayas' elegantly appointed period drama seems , at times , padded with incident in the way of a too-conscientious adaptation . . . its three-hour running time plays closer to two . 
0 ||| it sticks rigidly to the paradigm , rarely permitting its characters more than two obvious dimensions and repeatedly placing them in contrived , well-worn situations . 
1 ||| a wildly entertaining scan of evans' career . 
1 |||  . . . a triumph of emotionally and narratively complex filmmaking . 
0 ||| it's a stale , overused cocktail using the same olives since 1962 as garnish . not only is entry number twenty the worst of the brosnan bunch , it's one of the worst of the entire franchise . 
0 ||| some writer dude , i think his name was , uh , michael zaidan , was supposed to have like written the screenplay or something , but , dude , the only thing that i ever saw that was written down were the zeroes on my paycheck . 
0 ||| little more than a super-sized infomercial for the cable-sports channel and its summer x games . 
1 ||| murderous maids may well be the most comprehensive of these films and also strike closest to the truth . 
0 ||| a restrained ribisi convinces as an italian , though if ever a movie needed one of the actor's whiny jags to pump it up , this has to be among the rare ones . 
0 ||| [w]hile long on amiable monkeys and worthy environmentalism , jane goodall's wild chimpanzees is short on the thrills the oversize medium demands . 
1 ||| a must-see for fans of thoughtful war films and those interested in the sights and sounds of battle . 
1 ||| fairy-tale formula , serves as a paper skeleton for some very good acting , dialogue , comedy , direction and especially charm . 
0 ||| the film's tone and pacing are off almost from the get-go . 
1 ||| it's all entertaining enough , but don't look for any hefty anti-establishment message in what is essentially a whip-crack of a buddy movie that ends with a whimper . 
1 ||| the performances take the movie to a higher level . 
0 ||| is it a comedy ? a drama ? a romance ? a cartoon ? 
0 ||| crossroads feels like a teenybopper ed wood film , replete with the pubescent scandalous innuendo and the high-strung but flaccid drama . 
1 ||| alternates between deadpan comedy and heartbreaking loneliness and isn't afraid to provoke introspection in both its characters and its audience . 
0 ||| despite all the closed-door hanky-panky , the film is essentially juiceless . 
0 ||| the director mostly plays it straight , turning leys' fable into a listless climb down the social ladder . 
1 ||| that old adage about women being unknowable gets an exhilarating new interpretation in morvern callar . 
1 ||| it may not be history but then again , what if it is ? but it makes for one of the most purely enjoyable and satisfying evenings at the movies i've had in a while . 
1 ||| on its own , big trouble could be considered a funny little film . 
1 ||| credit director ramsay for taking the sometimes improbable story and making it feel realistic . 
0 ||| i have to admit i walked out of runteldat . i did go back and check out the last 10 minutes , but these were more repulsive than the first 30 or 40 minutes . 
1 ||| each punch seen through prison bars , the fights become not so much a struggle of man vs . man as brother-man vs . the man . 
1 ||| nothing's at stake , just a twisty double-cross you can smell a mile away--still , the derivative nine queens is lots of fun . 
0 ||| just too silly and sophomoric to ensnare its target audience . 
0 ||| the film might have been more satisfying if it had , in fact , been fleshed out a little more instead of going for easy smiles . 
1 ||| a weird , arresting little ride . 
1 ||| mr . spielberg and his company just want you to enjoy yourselves without feeling conned . and they succeed merrily at their noble endeavor . 
0 ||| solaris is rigid and evasive in ways that soderbergh's best films , " erin brockovich , " " out of sight " and " ocean's eleven , " never were . 
0 ||| it's played in the most straight-faced fashion , with little humor to lighten things up . the heavy-handed film is almost laughable as a consequence . 
0 ||| an unencouraging threefold expansion on the former mtv series , accompanying the stunt-hungry dimwits in a random series of collected gags , pranks , pratfalls , dares , injuries , etc . 
0 ||| if you want a movie time trip , the 1960 version is a far smoother ride . 
1 ||| it's about individual moments of mood , and an aimlessness that's actually sort of amazing . 
1 ||| a backstage must-see for true fans of comedy . 
1 ||| a superlative b movie -- funny , sexy , and rousing . 
1 ||| the message is that even the most unlikely can link together to conquer all kinds of obstacles , whether they be of nature , of man or of one another . 
0 ||| the advantage of a postapocalyptic setting is that it can be made on the cheap . any rock pile will do for a set . reign of fire has the disadvantage of also looking cheap . 
0 ||| a silly , self-indulgent film about a silly , self-indulgent filmmaker . 
0 ||| the story and the friendship proceeds in such a way that you're watching a soap opera rather than a chronicle of the ups and downs that accompany lifelong friendships . 
0 ||| partway through watching this saccharine , easter-egg-colored concoction , you realize that it is made up of three episodes of a rejected tv show . 
0 ||| in the real world , an actor this uncharismatically beautiful would have a r�sum� loaded with credits like " girl in bar #3 . " 
0 |||  . . . this movie has a glossy coat of action movie excess while remaining heartless at its core . 
1 ||| an exciting and involving rock music doc , a smart and satisfying look inside that tumultuous world . 
1 ||| a grimly competent and stolid and earnest military courtroom drama . 
0 ||| a rote exercise in both animation and storytelling . 
0 ||| a well-acted , but one-note film . 
0 ||| when a film is created solely because it's a marketable product , soulless and ugly movies like this are the result . let your silly childhood nostalgia slumber unmolested . 
1 ||| the story itself it mostly told through on-camera interviews with several survivors , whose riveting memories are rendered with such clarity that it's as if it all happened only yesterday . 
0 ||| it never rises to its clever what-if concept . 
0 ||| while the performances are often engaging , this loose collection of largely improvised numbers would probably have worked better as a one-hour tv documentary . 
1 ||| a refreshingly authentic coming-of-age tale . 
1 ||| provides the kind of 'laugh therapy' i need from movie comedies -- offbeat humor , amusing characters , and a happy ending . after seeing 'analyze that , ' i feel better already . 
0 ||| marinated in clich�s and mawkish dialogue . 
1 ||| late marriage is an in-your-face family drama and black comedy that is filled with raw emotions conveying despair and love . 
0 ||| the adventures of pluto nash is a whole lot of nada . 
1 ||| until its final minutes this is a perceptive study of two families in crisis -- and of two girls whose friendship is severely tested by bad luck and their own immaturity . 
1 ||| the symbols float like butterflies and the spinning styx sting like bees . i wanted more . 
1 ||| it pulls the rug out from under you , just when you're ready to hate one character , or really sympathize with another character , something happens to send you off in different direction . 
0 ||| loud , chaotic and largely unfunny . 
1 ||| the scorpion king is more fun than conan the barbarian . 
1 ||| who is the audience for cletis tout ? anybody who enjoys quirky , fun , popcorn movies with a touch of silliness and a little bloodshed . 
0 ||| too much of this well-acted but dangerously slow thriller feels like a preamble to a bigger , more complicated story , one that never materializes . 
0 ||| ong chooses to present ah na's life as a slight , weightless fairy tale , whose most unpleasant details seem to melt away in the face of the character's blank-faced optimism . 
1 ||| like dickens with his passages , mcgrath crafts quite moving scenes throughout his resolutely dramatic variation on the novel . 
0 ||| rather quickly , the film falls into a soothing formula of brotherly conflict and reconciliation . 
1 ||| cannon's confidence and laid-back good spirits are , with the drumming routines , among the film's saving graces . 
1 ||| it's definitely a step in the right direction . 
1 ||| it's as raw and action-packed an experience as a ringside seat at a tough-man contest . 
0 ||| there's too much falseness to the second half , and what began as an intriguing look at youth fizzles into a dull , ridiculous attempt at heart-tugging . 
0 ||| the rest of the plot is impossible to explain without blowing whatever tension there is , although it's more comedy than suspense de palma creates . 
1 ||| binoche and magimel are perfect in these roles . 
1 ||| a comedy-drama of nearly epic proportions rooted in a sincere performance by the title character undergoing midlife crisis . 
1 ||| the transporter is as lively and as fun as it is unapologetically dumb
0 ||| director yu seems far more interested in gross-out humor than in showing us well-thought stunts or a car chase that we haven't seen 10 , 000 times . 
0 ||| leaves you with a knot in your stomach , its power is undercut by its own head-banging obviousness . 
1 ||| the film's constant mood of melancholy and its unhurried narrative are masterfully controlled . but � in trying to capture the novel's deeper intimate resonances , the film has � ironically - distanced us from the characters . 
0 ||| totally overwrought , deeply biased , and wholly designed to make you feel guilty about ignoring what the filmmakers clearly believe are the greatest musicians of all time . 
1 ||| the acting , costumes , music , cinematography and sound are all astounding given the production's austere locales . 
0 ||| everything in maid in manhattan is exceedingly pleasant , designed not to offend . it goes down easy , leaving virtually no aftertaste . 
0 ||| bartleby is a one-joke movie , and a bad joke at that . 
1 ||| deserves a place of honor next to nanook as a landmark in film history . 
0 ||| admirable , certainly , but not much fun to watch . for caine lovers only . 
1 ||| the result puts a human face on derrida , and makes one of the great minds of our times interesting and accessible to people who normally couldn't care less . 
0 ||| somewhere in the middle , the film compels , as demme experiments he harvests a few movie moment gems , but the field of roughage dominates . 
1 ||| often hilarious . 
1 ||| viveka seldahl and sven wollter will touch you to the core in a film you will never forget -- that you should never forget . 
1 ||| like its predecessor , it's no classic , but it provides a reasonably attractive holiday contraption , one that families looking for a clean , kid-friendly outing should investigate . 
0 ||| before long , the film starts playing like general hospital crossed with a saturday night live spoof of dog day afternoon . 
0 ||| the script falls back on too many tried-and-true shenanigans that hardly distinguish it from the next teen comedy . 
1 ||| terrific as nadia , a russian mail-order bride who comes to america speaking not a word of english , it's kidman who holds the film together with a supremely kittenish performance that gradually accumulates more layers . 
0 ||| plays like an unbalanced mixture of graphic combat footage and almost saccharine domestic interludes that are pure hollywood . 
0 ||| whether quitting will prove absorbing to american audiences is debatable . 
1 ||| the evocative imagery and gentle , lapping rhythms of this film are infectious -- it gets under our skin and draws us in long before the plot kicks into gear . 
1 ||| ambitious , unsettling psychodrama that takes full , chilling advantage of its rough-around-the-edges , low-budget constraints . 
1 ||| daughter from danang is a film that should be seen by all , especially those who aren't aware of , or have forgotten about the unmentioned victims of war . 
0 ||| other than a mildly engaging central romance , hospital is sickly entertainment at best and mind-destroying cinematic pollution at worst . 
1 ||| predictable storyline and by-the-book scripting is all but washed away by sumptuous ocean visuals and the cinematic stylings of director john stockwell . 
0 ||| looks and feels like a project better suited for the small screen . 
0 ||| too silly to be frightening , too stolid to be funny , it projects the same lazy affability as its nominal star , david arquette . 
0 ||| the movie's heavy-handed screenplay navigates a fast fade into pomposity and pretentiousness . 
1 ||| a pleasant romantic comedy . 
0 ||| one minute , you think you're watching a serious actioner ; the next , it's as though clips from the pink panther strikes again and/or sailor moon have been spliced in . 
1 ||| 'blue crush' swims away with the sleeper movie of the summer award . 
1 ||| an inuit masterpiece that will give you goosebumps as its uncanny tale of love , communal discord , and justice unfolds . 
1 ||| if you liked such movies as notting hill , four weddings and a funeral , bridget jones' diary or high fidelity , then you won't want to miss about a boy . 
0 ||| like its title character , esther kahn is unusual but unfortunately also irritating . 
1 ||| marshall puts a suspenseful spin on standard horror flick formula . 
0 ||| the director knows how to apply textural gloss , but his portrait of sex-as-war is strictly sitcom . 
1 ||| a remarkably alluring film set in the constrictive eisenhower era about one suburban woman's yearning in the face of a loss that shatters her cheery and tranquil suburban life . 
1 ||| the production has been made with an enormous amount of affection , so we believe these characters love each other . 
0 ||| some actors steal scenes . tom green just gives them a bad odor . this self-infatuated goofball is far from the only thing wrong with the clumsy comedy stealing harvard , but he's the most obvious one . 
0 ||| a bit too eager to please . 
1 ||| my wife's plotting is nothing special ; it's the delivery that matters here . 
1 ||| ramsay and morton fill this character study with poetic force and buoyant feeling . 
1 |||  . . . wise and elegiac . . . 
0 ||| alex nohe's documentary plays like a travelogue for what mostly resembles a real-life , big-budget nc-17 version of tank girl . 
0 ||| if it's another regurgitated action movie you're after , there's no better film than half past dead . 
1 ||| it's a rare window on an artistic collaboration . 
1 ||| not as distinctive or even as humorous as its needs to be to stand out , but it has clearly been made with affection and care . 
0 ||| viewing this underdramatized but overstated film is like watching a transcript of a therapy session brought to humdrum life by some freudian puppet . 
0 ||| ecks this one off your must-see list . 
0 ||| schnieder bounces around with limp wrists , wearing tight tummy tops and hip huggers , twirling his hair on his finger and assuming that's enough to sustain laughs . . . 
0 ||| in its own way , joshua is as blasphemous and nonsensical as a luis bu�uel film without the latter's attendant intelligence , poetry , passion , and genius . 
0 ||| tadpole is emblematic of the witless ageism afflicting films : young is cool , and too young is too cool . 
1 ||| a photographic marvel of sorts , and it's certainly an invaluable record of that special fishy community . 
1 ||| it arrives with an impeccable pedigree , mongrel pep , and almost indecipherable plot complications . 
0 ||| i don't mind having my heartstrings pulled , but don't treat me like a fool . 
0 ||| lacks the visual flair and bouncing bravado that characterizes better hip-hop clips and is content to recycle images and characters that were already tired 10 years ago . 
0 ||| when cowering and begging at the feet a scruffy giannini , madonna gives her best performance since abel ferrara had her beaten to a pulp in his dangerous game . 
0 ||| abysmally pathetic
1 ||| the sentimental script has problems , but the actors pick up the slack . 
1 ||| the dirty jokes provide the funniest moments in this oddly sweet comedy about jokester highway patrolmen . 
1 ||| not the kind of film that will appeal to a mainstream american audience , but there is a certain charm about the film that makes it a suitable entry into the fest circuit . 
1 ||| a chance to see three splendid actors turn a larky chase movie into an emotionally satisfying exploration of the very human need to be somebody , and to belong to somebody . 
1 ||| this new zealand coming-of-age movie isn't really about anything . when it's this rich and luscious , who cares ? 
0 ||| what kids will discover is a new collectible . what parents will suspect is that they're watching a 76-minute commercial . 
0 ||| like an afterschool special with costumes by gianni versace , mad love looks better than it feels . 
0 ||| perry's good and his is an interesting character , but " serving sara " hasn't much more to serve than silly fluff . nor is it a romantic comedy . 
1 ||| the leaping story line , shaped by director peter kosminsky into sharp slivers and cutting impressions , shows all the signs of rich detail condensed into a few evocative images and striking character traits . 
0 ||| nothing happens , and it happens to flat characters . 
0 ||| labute can't avoid a fatal mistake in the modern era : he's changed the male academic from a lower-class brit to an american , a choice that upsets the novel's exquisite balance and shreds the fabric of the film . 
0 ||| it kinda works and qualifies as cool at times , but is just too lame to work or be cool at others . 
1 ||| blithely anachronistic and slyly achronological . 
0 ||| for all the charm of kevin kline and a story that puts old-fashioned values under the microscope , there's something creepy about this movie . 
0 ||| little more than a frothy vanity project . 
1 ||| the level of maturity displayed by this 33-year-old first-time feature director is astonishing , considering her inexperience and her subject matter . 
1 ||| [ramsay] visually transforms the dreary expanse of dead-end distaste the characters inhabit into a poem of art , music and metaphor . 
0 ||| as crimes go , writer-director michael kalesniko's how to kill your neighbor's dog is slight but unendurable . 
0 ||| it's super- violent , super-serious and super-stupid . 
1 ||| whether our action-and-popcorn obsessed culture will embrace this engaging and literate psychodrama isn't much of a mystery , unfortunately . 
1 ||| with wit and empathy to spare , waydowntown acknowledges the silent screams of workaday inertia but stops short of indulging its characters' striving solipsism . 
1 ||| every moment crackles with tension , and by the end of the flick , you're on the edge of your seat . 
1 ||| sensual , funny and , in the end , very touching . 
0 ||| [it's] a prison soccer movie starring charismatic tough guy vinnie jones , but it had too much spitting for me to enjoy . 
0 ||| as an entertainment destination for the general public , kung pow sets a new benchmark for lameness . 
1 ||| about schmidt is undoubtedly one of the finest films of the year . if you're not deeply touched by this movie , check your pulse . 
0 ||| with its lackadaisical plotting and mindless action , all about the benjamins evokes the bottom tier of blaxploitation flicks from the 1970s . 
0 ||| the re- enactments , however fascinating they may be as history , are too crude to serve the work especially well . 
0 ||| the photographer's show-don't-tell stance is admirable , but it can make him a problematic documentary subject . 
1 ||| warm in its loving yet unforgivingly inconsistent depiction of everyday people , relaxed in its perfect quiet pace and proud in its message . i loved this film . 
1 ||| exudes the fizz of a busby berkeley musical and the visceral excitement of a sports extravaganza . 
1 ||| an unflinching , complex portrait of a modern israel that is rarely seen on-screen . 
0 ||| this is the type of movie best enjoyed by frat boys and college kids while sucking on the bong and downing one alcoholic beverage after another . 
0 ||| the entire movie is in need of a scented bath . 
0 ||| nicolas cage isn't the first actor to lead a group of talented friends astray , and this movie won't create a ruffle in what is already an erratic career . 
0 ||| like a documentary version of fight club , shorn of social insight , intellectual pretension and cinematic interest . 
1 ||| awesome work : ineffable , elusive , yet inexplicably powerful
0 ||| i loved looking at this movie . i just didn't care as much for the story . 
1 ||| angel presents events partly from the perspective of aurelie and christelle , and infuses the film with the sensibility of a particularly nightmarish fairytale . 
1 ||| godard has never made a more sheerly beautiful film than this unexpectedly moving meditation on love , history , memory , resistance and artistic transcendence . 
0 ||| get out your pooper-scoopers . 
1 ||| you may leave the theater with more questions than answers , but darned if your toes won't still be tapping . 
1 ||| a sensitive and expertly acted crowd-pleaser that isn't above a little broad comedy and a few unabashedly sentimental tears . 
0 ||| they do a good job of painting this family dynamic for the audience but they tried to squeeze too many elements into the film . 
1 ||| claude miller airs out a tight plot with an easy pace and a focus on character drama over crime-film complications . 
1 ||| massoud's story is an epic , but also a tragedy , the record of a tenacious , humane fighter who was also the prisoner ( and ultimately the victim ) of history . 
1 ||| a riveting documentary . 
1 ||| this insightful , oscar-nominated documentary , in which children on both sides of the ever-escalating conflict have their say away from watchful parental eyes , gives peace yet another chance . 
1 ||| [there's] quite a bit of heart , as you would expect from the directors of the little mermaid and aladdin . 
0 ||| this isn't a terrible film by any means , but it's also far from being a realized work . 
1 ||| imamura has said that warm water under a red bridge is a poem to the enduring strengths of women . it may also be the best sex comedy about environmental pollution ever made . 
1 ||| superb production values & christian bale's charisma make up for a derivative plot . 
1 ||| macdowell , whose wifty southern charm has anchored lighter affairs . . . brings an absolutely riveting conviction to her role . 
1 ||| suffice to say that after seeing this movie in imax form , you'll be more acquainted with the tiniest details of tom hanks' face than his wife is . 
0 ||| your appreciation of it will depend on what experiences you bring to it and what associations you choose to make . 
1 ||| entertains by providing good , lively company . 
0 ||| even if you're an elvis person , you won't find anything to get excited about on this dvd . 
0 ||| there's a whole heap of nothing at the core of this slight coming-of-age/coming-out tale . 
0 ||| even in this less-than-magic kingdom , reese rules . 
0 ||| excruciatingly unfunny and pitifully unromantic . 
1 ||| it is so refreshing to see robin williams turn 180 degrees from the string of insultingly innocuous and sappy fiascoes he's been making for the last several years . 
0 ||| what's missing is what we call the 'wow' factor . 
0 ||| fails to satisfactorily exploit its gender politics , genre thrills or inherent humor . 
1 |||  . . . gripping and handsome execution , ( but ) there isn't much about k-19 that's unique or memorable . 
0 ||| wins my vote for 'the 2002 enemy of cinema' award . 
0 ||| the only time 8 crazy nights comes close to hitting a comedic or satirical target is during the offbeat musical numbers . 
0 ||| who are 'they' ? well , they're 'they' . they're the unnamed , easily substitutable forces that serve as whatever terror the heroes of horror movies try to avoid . they exist for hushed lines like " they're back ! " , " they're out there ! " and " they're coming ! " 
0 ||| whatever satire lucky break was aiming for , it certainly got lost in the " soon-to-be-forgettable " section of the quirky rip-off prison romp pile . it's petty thievery like this that puts flimsy flicks like this behind bars
1 ||| 'moore is like a progressive bull in a china shop , a provocateur crashing into ideas and special-interest groups as he slaps together his own brand of liberalism . '
0 ||| this 10th film in the series looks and feels tired . 
1 ||| over-the-top and a bit ostentatious , this is a movie that's got oodles of style and substance . 
0 ||| a dopey movie clothed in excess layers of hipness . 
0 ||| everything is pegged into the groove of a new york dating comedy with 'issues' to simplify . 
1 ||| norton holds the film together . 
0 ||| the movie fails to portray its literarily talented and notorious subject as anything much more than a dirty old man . 
1 ||| angela gheorghiu as famous prima donna floria tosca , roberto alagna as her lover mario cavaradossi , and ruggero as the villainous , lecherous police chief scarpia , all sing beautifully and act adequately . 
0 ||| i found myself more appreciative of what the director was trying to do than of what he had actually done . 
0 ||| has all the hallmarks of a movie designed strictly for children's home video , a market so insatiable it absorbs all manner of lame entertainment , as long as 3-year-olds find it diverting . 
1 ||| para hitler , o mundo era sua tela ; e o horror , seu pincel . e max retrata este fato com elegante abandono , numa triste constata��o da realidade hist�rica . 
0 ||| just one more collection of penis , breast and flatulence gags in search of a story . or a profit . or some damn thing . 
1 ||| expands the limits of what a film can be , taking us into the lives of women to whom we might not give a second look if we passed them on the street . 
0 ||| proof that a thriller can be sleekly shot , expertly cast , paced with crisp professionalism . . . and still be a letdown if its twists and turns hold no more surprise than yesterday's weather report . 
1 ||| unlike most anime , whose most ardent fans outside japan seem to be introverted young men with fantasy fetishes , metropolis never seems hopelessly juvenile . 
0 ||| [a] soulless , stupid sequel . . . 
1 ||| nicole holofcener's lovely and amazing , from her own screenplay , jumps to the head of the class of women's films that manage to avoid the ghetto of sentimental chick-flicks by treating female follies with a satirical style . 
0 ||| the camera whirls ! the camera twirls ! oh , look at that clever angle ! wow , a jump cut ! 
0 ||| i wish it would have just gone more over-the-top instead of trying to have it both ways . 
1 ||| on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , the powerpuff girls is a fast , frenetic , funny , even punny 6 -- aimed specifically at a grade-school audience . 
1 ||| secret ballot is a funny , puzzling movie ambiguous enough to be engaging and oddly moving . 
0 ||| watching the powerpuff girls movie , my mind kept returning to one anecdote for comparison : the cartoon in japan that gave people seizures . 
1 ||| it's definitely an improvement on the first blade , since it doesn't take itself so deadly seriously . 
1 |||  " the ring " is pretty much an english-language copy of the film that inspired it , and it carries the same strengths and flaws . 
0 ||| this is nothing but familiar territory . 
1 ||| tsai ming-liang's ghosts are painfully aware of their not-being . 
0 ||| instead of a balanced film that explains the zeitgeist that is the x games , we get a cinematic postcard that's superficial and unrealized . 
1 ||| a compelling journey . . . and " his best friend remembers " is up there with the finest of specials . 
0 ||| i cry for i spy -- or i would if this latest and laziest imaginable of all vintage-tv spinoffs were capable of engendering an emotional response of any kind . 
0 ||| not once in the rush to save the day did i become very involved in the proceedings ; to me , it was just a matter of 'eh . '
1 ||| if the plot seems a bit on the skinny side , that's because panic room is interested in nothing more than sucking you in�and making you sweat . 
0 ||| it will probably prove interesting to ram dass fans , but to others it may feel like a parody of the mellow , peace-and-love side of the '60s counterculture . 
1 ||| a depressing confirmation of everything those of us who don't object to the description " unelected " have suspected all along : george w . bush is an incurious , uncharismatic , overgrown frat boy with a mean streak a mile wide . 
0 ||| it's as if solondz had two ideas for two movies , couldn't really figure out how to flesh either out , so he just slopped �em together here . 
1 ||| [fincher's] camera sense and assured pacing make it an above-average thriller . 
0 ||| unsurprisingly , the way this all works out makes the women look more like stereotypical caretakers and moral teachers , instead of serious athletes . 
0 ||| in my own very humble opinion , in praise of love lacks even the most fragmented charms i have found in almost all of his previous works . 
1 ||| to the film's credit , the acting is fresh and unselfconscious , and munch is a marvel of reality versus sappy sentiment . 
0 ||| a film so tedious that it is impossible to care whether that boast is true or not . 
1 ||| a movie that will touch the hearts of both children and adults , as well as bring audiences to the edge of their seats . 
1 ||| a screenplay more ingeniously constructed than " memento " 
1 ||| never lets go your emotions , taking them to surprising highs , sorrowful lows and hidden impulsive niches . . . gorgeous , passionate , and at times uncommonly moving . 
1 ||| the film is reasonably entertaining , though it begins to drag two-thirds through , when the melodramatic aspects start to overtake the comedy . 
1 ||| terrific casting and solid execution give all three stories life . 
1 ||| it's both a necessary political work and a fascinating documentary . . . 
0 ||| a thoroughly awful movie--dumb , narratively chaotic , visually sloppy . . . a weird amalgam of 'the thing' and a geriatric 'scream . '
0 ||| sometimes makes less sense than the bruckheimeresque american action flicks it emulates . 
1 ||| even as it pays earnest homage to turntablists and beat jugglers , old schoolers and current innovators , scratch is great fun , full of the kind of energy it's documenting . 
1 ||| kept aloft largely by a comically adept ensemble . 
0 ||| it gets bogged down by hit-and-miss topical humour before getting to the truly good stuff . 
1 ||| light , cute and forgettable . 
0 ||| my response to the film is best described as lukewarm . maybe i found the proceedings a little bit too conventional . 
1 ||| a recent favourite at sundance , this white-trash satire will inspire the affection of even those unlucky people who never owned a cassette of def leppard's pyromania . 
0 ||| the movie slides downhill as soon as macho action conventions assert themselves . 
1 ||| a stirring tribute to the bravery and dedication of the world's reporters who willingly walk into the nightmare of war not only to record the events for posterity , but to help us clearly see the world of our making . 
1 ||| although life or something like it is very much in the mold of feel-good movies , the cast and director stephen herek's polished direction pour delightfully piquant wine from aged bottles . 
1 ||| the story gives ample opportunity for large-scale action and suspense , which director shekhar kapur supplies with tremendous skill . 
0 ||| the characters are so generic and the plot so bland that even as rogue cia assassins working for chris cooper's agency boss close in on the resourceful amnesiac , we don't feel much for damon/bourne or his predicament . 
1 ||| perhaps not since nelson eddy crooned his indian love call to jeanette macdonald has there been a movie so unabashedly canadian , not afraid to risk american scorn or disinterest . 
1 ||| another love story in 2002's remarkable procession of sweeping pictures that have reinvigorated the romance genre . 
0 ||| without a strong script and energetic acting , dogma films can produce the same sleep-inducing effects as watching your neighbor's home videos . 
0 ||| the problem with this film is that it's forced to make its characters idiots in order to advance the plot . had anyone here done anything remotely intelligent , we all could have stopped watching long ago . 
0 ||| unfortunately , the picture failed to capture me . i found it slow , drab , and bordering on melodramatic . 
1 ||| the movie is for fans who can't stop loving anime , and the fanatical excess built into it . 
0 ||| a picture as erratic as its central character . 
1 ||| what's most striking about this largely celebratory film . . . is the sense of isolation that permeates these bastions of individuality in an ikea world . 
0 ||| showtime is closer to slowtime . 
0 ||| bears resemblance to , and shares the weaknesses of , too many recent action-fantasy extravaganzas in which special effects overpower cogent story-telling and visual clarity during the big action sequences . 
1 ||| steven soderbergh doesn't remake andrei tarkovsky's solaris so much as distill it . 
1 ||| to some eyes this will seem like a recycling of clich�s , an assassin's greatest hits . to others , it will remind them that hong kong action cinema is still alive and kicking . 
1 ||| mostly honest , this somber picture reveals itself slowly , intelligently , artfully . 
0 ||| it's got the brawn , but not the brains . 
1 ||| witherspoon puts to rest her valley-girl image , but it's dench who really steals the show . 
1 ||| gorgeous scenes , masterful performances , but the sickly sweet gender normative narrative left an acrid test in this gourmet's mouth . 
1 ||| the saigon of 1952 is an uneasy mix of sensual delights and simmering violence , and the quiet american brings us right into the center of that world . 
0 ||| despite its title , amy's orgasm is not a porno , though it is as tedious as one . 
1 ||| has enough wit , energy and geniality to please not only the fanatical adherents on either side , but also people who know nothing about the subject and think they're not interested . 
0 ||| flounders due to the general sense that no two people working on the production had exactly the same thing in mind . 
0 ||| been there , done that , liked it much better the first time around - when it was called the professional . 
1 ||| majidi is an unconventional storyteller , capable of finding beauty in the most depressing places . 
0 ||| it's a grab bag of genres that don't add up to a whole lot of sense . 
1 ||| a simple , but gritty and well-acted ensemble drama that encompasses a potent metaphor for a country still dealing with its fascist past . 
0 ||| only two-fifths of a satisfying movie experience . 
0 ||| high crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government/ marine/legal mystery , and that's because the movie serves up all of that stuff , nearly subliminally , as the old-hat province of male intrigue . 
0 ||| demme's loose approach kills the suspense . 
0 ||| more of an intriguing curiosity than a gripping thriller . 
0 ||| master of disguise runs for only 71 minutes and feels like three hours . 
1 ||| made-up lampoons the moviemaking process itself , while shining a not particularly flattering spotlight on america's skin-deep notions of pulchritude . 
1 ||| from blushing to gushing---imamura squirts the screen in �warm water under a red bridge'
1 ||| a fantastic premise anchors this movie , but what it needs is either a more rigid , blair witch-style commitment to its mockumentary format , or a more straightforward , dramatic treatment , with all the grandiosity that that implies . 
0 ||| unfortunately , kapur modernizes a . e . w . mason's story to suit the sensibilities of a young american , a decision that plucks " the four feathers " bare . 
0 ||| it shows that some studios firmly believe that people have lost the ability to think and will forgive any shoddy product as long as there's a little girl-on-girl action . 
1 ||| a moody horror/thriller elevated by deft staging and the director's well-known narrative gamesmanship . 
1 ||| the film starts out as competent but unremarkable . . . and gradually grows into something of considerable power . 
1 ||| raimi crafted a complicated hero who is a welcome relief from the usual two-dimensional offerings . 
0 ||| whaley's determination to immerse you in sheer , unrelenting wretchedness is exhausting . 
0 ||| you have once again entered the bizarre realm where director adrian lyne holds sway , where all relationships are simultaneously broadly metaphorical , oddly abstract , and excruciatingly literal . 
1 ||| the unique niche of self-critical , behind-the-scenes navel-gazing kaufman has carved from orleans' story and his own infinite insecurity is a work of outstanding originality . 
0 ||| there's only one way to kill michael myers for good : stop buying tickets to these movies . 
1 ||| while parker and co-writer catherine di napoli are faithful to melville's plotline , they and a fully engaged supporting cast . . . have made the old boy's characters more quick-witted than any english lit major would have thought possible . 
1 ||| flamboyant in some movies and artfully restrained in others , 65-year-old jack nicholson could be looking at his 12th oscar nomination by proving that he's now , more than ever , choosing his roles with the precision of the insurance actuary . 
1 ||| sparse but oddly compelling . 
0 ||| sometimes , fond memories should stay in the past : a lesson this film teaches all too well . 
0 ||| it delivers some chills and sustained unease , but flounders in its quest for deeper meaning . 
1 ||| candid and comfortable ; a film that deftly balances action and reflection as it lets you grasp and feel the passion others have for their work . 
0 ||| woody allen has really found his groove these days . the problem is that it is one that allows him to churn out one mediocre movie after another . 
0 ||| five screenwriters are credited with the clich�-laden screenplay ; it seems as if each watered down the version of the one before . 
1 ||| boisterous , heartfelt comedy . 
1 ||| a stylish cast and some clever scripting solutions help chicago make the transition from stage to screen with considerable appeal intact . 
1 ||| witty dialog between realistic characters showing honest emotions . it's touching and tender and proves that even in sorrow you can find humor . like blended shades of lipstick , these components combine into one terrific story with lots of laughs . 
0 ||| � is an arthritic attempt at directing by callie khouri . i had to look away - this was god awful . 
0 ||| what's next : " my mother the car ? " 
1 ||| i stopped thinking about how good it all was , and started doing nothing but reacting to it - feeling a part of its grand locations , thinking urgently as the protagonists struggled , feeling at the mercy of its inventiveness , gasping at its visual delights . 
0 ||| [n]o matter how much good will the actors generate , showtime eventually folds under its own thinness . 
1 ||| short-story quaint , touchingly mending a child's pain for his dead mother via communication with an old woman straight out of eudora welty . 
0 ||| ultimately . . . the movie is too heady for children , and too preachy for adults . 
1 ||| [a] superbly controlled , passionate adaptation of graham greene's 1955 novel . 
0 ||| slapstick buffoonery can tickle many a preschooler's fancy , but when it costs a family of four about $40 to see a film in theaters , why spend money on a dog like this when you can rent a pedigree instead ? 
0 ||| go , girls , right down the reality drain . 
0 ||| much like its easily dismissive take on the upscale lifestyle , there isn't much there here . 
1 ||| the byplay and bickering between the now spy-savvy siblings , carmen ( vega ) and juni ( sabara ) cortez , anchor the film in a very real and amusing give-and-take . 
0 ||| benigni presents himself as the boy puppet pinocchio , complete with receding hairline , weathered countenance and american breckin meyer's ridiculously inappropriate valley boy voice . 
0 ||| the film's lack of personality permeates all its aspects � from the tv movie-esque , affected child acting to the dullest irish pub scenes ever filmed . 
1 ||| with dirty deeds , david caesar has stepped into the mainstream of filmmaking with an assurance worthy of international acclaim and with every cinematic tool well under his control -- driven by a natural sense for what works on screen . 
0 |||  . . . [a] strained comedy that jettisons all opportunities for rock to make his mark by serving up the usual chaotic nonsense . 
0 ||| with flashbulb editing as cover for the absence of narrative continuity , undisputed is nearly incoherent , an excuse to get to the closing bout . . . by which time it's impossible to care who wins . 
1 ||| as a director , mr . ratliff wisely rejects the temptation to make fun of his subjects . 
0 ||| at times , however , dogtown and z-boys lapses into an insider's lingo and mindset that the uninitiated may find hard to follow , or care about . 
0 ||| it is too bad that this likable movie isn't more accomplished . the actors try hard but come off too amateurish and awkward . 
1 ||| features one of the most affecting depictions of a love affair ever committed to film . 
1 ||| an enthralling , playful film that constantly frustrates our desire to know the 'truth' about this man , while deconstructing the very format of the biography in a manner that derrida would doubtless give his blessing to . 
1 ||| an original and highly cerebral examination of the psychopathic mind
0 ||| the movie would seem less of a trifle if ms . sugarman followed through on her defiance of the saccharine . 
1 ||| a moving and not infrequently breathtaking film . 
1 ||| martyr gets royally screwed and comes back for more . 
0 ||| slap me , i saw this movie . 
0 ||| in addition to sporting one of the worst titles in recent cinematic history , ballistic : ecks vs . sever also features terrible , banal dialogue ; convenient , hole-ridden plotting ; superficial characters and a rather dull , unimaginative car chase . 
0 ||| an empty exercise , a florid but ultimately vapid crime melodrama with lots of surface flash but little emotional resonance . 
0 ||| wouldn't it be funny if a bunch of allied soldiers went undercover as women in a german factory during world war ii ? um , no . but here's a movie about it anyway . 
0 ||| 'rare birds' tries to force its quirkiness upon the audience . 
1 ||| a delightful little film that revels in its own simplicity , mostly martha will leave you with a smile on your face and a grumble in your stomach . 
0 ||| the irony is that this film's cast is uniformly superb ; their performances could have -- should have -- been allowed to stand on their own . 
1 |||  " the emperor's new clothes " begins with a simple plan . . . . well , at least that's the plan . 
0 ||| in execution , this clever idea is far less funny than the original , killers from space . 
0 ||| comedy troupe broken lizard's first movie is very funny but too concerned with giving us a plot . 
1 ||| a fine film , but it would be a lot better if it stuck to betty fisher and left out the other stories . 
0 ||| what could have been a neat little story about believing in yourself is swamped by heavy-handed melodrama . 
0 |||  . . . blade ii is still top-heavy with blazing guns , cheatfully filmed martial arts , disintegrating bloodsucker computer effects and jagged camera moves that serve no other purpose than to call attention to themselves . 
0 ||| the movie has generic virtues , and despite a lot of involved talent , seems done by the numbers . 
0 ||| i approached the usher and said that if she had to sit through it again , she should ask for a raise . 
0 ||| only those most addicted to film violence in all its forms will find anything here to appreciate . 
0 ||| shamelessly sappy and , worse , runs away from its own provocative theme . 
0 ||| amazingly dopey . 
0 ||| nothing about this movie works . 
1 ||| awesome creatures , breathtaking scenery , and epic battle scenes add up to another 'spectacular spectacle . '
1 ||| thoroughly enjoyable . 
1 ||| the hypnotic imagery and fragmentary tale explore the connections between place and personal identity . 
0 ||| director george hickenlooper has had some success with documentaries , but here his sense of story and his juvenile camera movements smack of a film school undergrad , and his maudlin ending might not have gotten him into film school in the first place . 
1 ||| what a concept , what an idea , what a thrill ride . this is a more fascinating look at the future than " bladerunner " and one of the most high-concept sci fi adventures attempted for the screen . 
0 ||| how do you make a movie with depth about a man who lacked any ? on the evidence before us , the answer is clear : not easily and , in the end , not well enough . 
1 ||| unlike lots of hollywood fluff , this has layered , well-developed characters and some surprises . 
0 ||| feels less like a change in [herzog's] personal policy than a half-hearted fluke . 
1 ||| few films have captured the chaos of an urban conflagration with such fury , and audience members will leave feeling as shaken as nesbitt's cooper looks when the bullets stop flying . 
0 ||| not everything in the film works , including its somewhat convenient ending . 
1 ||| despite its flaws . . . belinsky is still able to create an engaging story that keeps you guessing at almost every turn . 
0 ||| the movie is like a year late for tapping into our reality tv obsession , and even tardier for exploiting the novelty of the " webcast . " 
0 ||| apparently writer-director attal thought he need only cast himself and his movie-star wife sitting around in their drawers to justify a film . 
0 ||| i admire it and yet cannot recommend it , because it overstays its natural running time . 
0 ||| a great ending doesn't make up for a weak movie , and crazy as hell doesn't even have a great ending . 
0 ||| the party scenes deliver some tawdry kicks . the rest of the film . . . is dudsville . 
0 ||| van wilder brings a whole new meaning to the phrase 'comedy gag . ' at least one scene is so disgusting that viewers may be hard pressed to retain their lunch . 
0 ||| what might have been acceptable on the printed page of iles' book does not translate well to the screen . 
0 ||| a few pieces of the film buzz and whir ; very little of it actually clicks . the thing just never gets off the ground . 
0 ||| this formulaic chiller will do little to boost stallone's career . 
0 ||| this time kaufman's imagination has failed him . 
1 ||| may be far from the best of the series , but it's assured , wonderfully respectful of its past and thrilling enough to make it abundantly clear that this movie phenomenon has once again reinvented itself for a new generation . 
0 ||| a nearly 21/2 hours , the film is way too indulgent . 
0 ||| an artful yet depressing film that makes a melodramatic mountain out of the molehill of a missing bike . 
1 ||| the soundtrack alone is worth the price of admission . 
1 ||| [russell] makes good b movies ( the mask , the blob ) , and the scorpion king more than ably meets those standards . 
1 ||| it's one of the saddest films i have ever seen that still manages to be uplifting but not overly sentimental . 
1 ||| if you sometimes like to go to the movies to have fun , wasabi is a good place to start . 
0 ||| in this film , aussie david caesar channels the not-quite-dead career of guy ritchie . 
1 ||| sweet home alabama " is what it is � a nice , harmless date film . . . 
1 ||| the combination of lightness and strictness in this instance gives italian for beginners an amiable aimlessness that keeps it from seeming predictably formulaic . 
1 ||| compared to his series of spectacular belly flops both on and off the screen , runteldat is something of a triumph . 
0 ||| more intellectually scary than dramatically involving . 
1 ||| below may not mark mr . twohy's emergence into the mainstream , but his promise remains undiminished . 
1 ||| not only does spider-man deliver , but i suspect it might deliver again and again . 
0 |||  . . . contains very few laughs and even less surprises . 
0 ||| star trek was kind of terrific once , but now it is a copy of a copy of a copy . 
1 ||| return to never land may be another shameless attempt by disney to rake in dough from baby boomer families , but it's not half-bad . 
0 ||| the sweetest thing is expressly for idiots who don't care what kind of sewage they shovel into their mental gullets to simulate sustenance . 
0 ||| melanie eventually slugs the yankee . too bad the former murphy brown doesn't pop reese back . 
0 ||| the somber pacing and lack of dramatic fireworks make green dragon seem more like medicine than entertainment . 
0 ||| the movie spends more time with schneider than with newcomer mcadams , even though her performance is more interesting ( and funnier ) than his . 
1 ||| the appearance of treebeard and gollum's expanded role will either have you loving what you're seeing , or rolling your eyes . i loved it ! gollum's 'performance' is incredible ! 
0 ||| a better title , for all concerned , might be swept under the rug . 
1 ||| this is simply the most fun you'll ever have with a documentary ! 
0 ||| calculated swill . 
1 ||| this time out , [sade] is an unsettlingly familiar figure -- in turns loyal and deceitful , responsible and reckless , idealistically selfless and coldly self-interested . 
0 ||| as it stands , crocodile hunter has the hurried , badly cobbled look of the 1959 godzilla , which combined scenes of a japanese monster flick with canned shots of raymond burr commenting on the monster's path of destruction . 
0 ||| interesting , but not compelling . 
1 ||| confessions is without a doubt a memorable directorial debut from king hunk . 
1 ||| for anyone unfamiliar with pentacostal practices in general and theatrical phenomenon of hell houses in particular , it's an eye-opener . 
1 ||| it's a cool event for the whole family . maybe not a classic , but a movie the kids will want to see over and over again . 
1 ||| confessions may not be a straightforward bio , nor does it offer much in the way of barris' motivations , but the film is an oddly fascinating depiction of an architect of pop culture . 
0 ||| smug , artificial , ill-constructed and fatally overlong . . . it never finds a consistent tone and lacks bite , degenerating into a pious , preachy soap opera . 
0 ||| it appears as if even the filmmakers didn't know what kind of movie they were making . 
1 ||| an unorthodox little film noir organized crime story that includes one of the strangest love stories you will ever see . 
1 ||| yakusho and shimizu . . . create engaging characterizations in imamura's lively and enjoyable cultural mix . 
1 ||| as a randy film about sexy people in gorgeous places being pushed and pulled ( literally and figuratively ) by desire . . . [sex and luc�a] makes for an arousing good time . 
1 ||| i simply can't recommend it enough . 
1 ||| the spark of special anime magic here is unmistakable and hard to resist . 
1 ||| works as pretty contagious fun . 
1 ||| behind the snow games and lovable siberian huskies ( plus one sheep dog ) , the picture hosts a parka-wrapped dose of heart . 
0 ||| this isn't just the cliffsnotes version of nicholas nickleby , it's the cliffsnotes with pages missing . 
0 |||  . . . watching this film nearly provoked me to take my own life . and if the hours wins 'best picture' i just might . 
1 ||| the story has some nice twists but the ending and some of the back-story is a little tired . the performances are all solid ; it merely lacks originality to make it a great movie . 
0 ||| despite suffering a sense-of-humour failure , the man who wrote rocky does not deserve to go down with a ship as leaky as this . 
1 ||| the film is impressive for the sights and sounds of the wondrous beats the world has to offer . 
1 ||| scherfig's light-hearted profile of emotional desperation is achingly honest and delightfully cheeky . 
0 ||| this isn't even madonna's swept away . this is her blue lagoon . 
0 ||| though tom shadyac's film kicks off spookily enough , around the halfway mark it takes an abrupt turn into glucose sentimentality and laughable contrivance . 
0 ||| some body is a shaky , uncertain film that nevertheless touches a few raw nerves . 
0 ||| holden caulfield did it better . 
0 |||  . . . a plotline that's as lumpy as two-day old porridge . . . the filmmakers' paws , sad to say , were all over this " un-bear-able " project ! 
1 ||| as weber and weissman demonstrate with such insight and celebratory verve , the cockettes weren't as much about gender , sexual preference or political agitprop as they were simply a triumph of the indomitable human will to rebel , connect and create . 
0 ||| director uwe boll and writer robert dean klein fail to generate any interest in an unsympathetic hero caught up in an intricate plot that while cleverly worked out , cannot overcome blah characters . 
1 ||| chouraqui brings documentary-like credibility to the horrors of the killing field and the barbarism of 'ethnic cleansing . '
0 ||| hollywood's answer to an air ball . 
1 ||| thanks to scott's charismatic roger and eisenberg's sweet nephew , roger dodger is one of the most compelling variations on in the company of men . 
1 ||| a beautiful , timeless and universal tale of heated passions -- jealousy , betrayal , forgiveness and murder . 
1 ||| it's about issues most adults have to face in marriage and i think that's what i liked about it -- the real issues tucked between the silly and crude storyline . 
1 ||| the banter between calvin and his fellow barbers feels like a streetwise mclaughlin group . . . and never fails to entertain . 
0 ||| with minimal imagination , you could restage the whole thing in your bathtub . 
1 ||| poignant japanese epic about adolescent anomie and heartbreak . 
1 ||| manages to be sweet and wickedly satisfying at the same time . 
1 ||| cineasts will revel in those visual in-jokes , as in the film's verbal pokes at everything from the likes of miramax chief harvey weinstein's bluff personal style to the stylistic rigors of denmark's dogma movement . 
1 ||| in its ragged , cheap and unassuming way , the movie works . 
1 ||| the filmmakers skillfully evoke the sense of menace that nature holds for many urban dwellers . 
0 |||  . . . nothing scary here except for some awful acting and lame special effects . 
0 ||| the furious coherence that [deniro] brings to this part only underscores the fuzzy sentimentality of the movie itself , which feels , as it plods toward the end , less like a movie than like the filmed reading of a script in need of polishing . 
1 ||| writer/ director m . night shyamalan's ability to pull together easily accessible stories that resonate with profundity is undeniable . 
0 ||| an infuriating film . just when you think you are making sense of it , something happens that tells you there is no sense . 
1 ||| the hard-to-predict and absolutely essential chemistry between the down-to-earth bullock and the nonchalant grant proves to be sensational , and everything meshes in this elegant entertainment . 
0 ||| hard as this may be to believe , here on earth , a surprisingly similar teen drama , was a better film . 
1 ||| wise and deadpan humorous . 
0 ||| this is the case of a pregnant premise being wasted by a script that takes few chances and manages to insult the intelligence of everyone in the audience . 
0 ||| sheridan had a wonderful account to work from , but , curiously , he waters it down , turning grit and vulnerability into light reading . 
0 ||| this long and relentlessly saccharine film is a clear case of preaching to the converted . 
1 ||| often overwrought and at times positively irritating , the film turns into an engrossing thriller almost in spite of itself . 
1 ||| in a movie full of surprises , the biggest is that secret ballot is a comedy , both gentle and biting . 
0 ||| the soupy end result has the odd distinction of being playful without being fun , too . 
0 ||| one of those films that seems tailor made to air on pay cable to offer some modest amusements when one has nothing else to watch . 
0 ||| the trappings of i spy are so familiar you might as well be watching a rerun . 
0 ||| hopelessly inane , humorless and under-inspired . 
0 ||| at once overly old-fashioned in its sudsy plotting and heavy-handed in its effort to modernize it with encomia to diversity and tolerance . 
0 ||| i still can't relate to stuart : he's a mouse , for cryin' out loud , and all he does is milk it with despondent eyes and whine that nobody treats him human enough . 
1 ||| atom egoyan has conjured up a multilayered work that tackles any number of fascinating issues
1 ||| using his audience as a figurative port-of-call , dong pulls his even-handed ideological ship to their dock for unloading , before he continues his longer journey still ahead . 
0 ||| feels like the grittiest movie that was ever made for the lifetime cable television network . 
0 ||| good-looking but relentlessly lowbrow outing plays like clueless does south fork . 
0 ||| sounding like arnold schwarzenegger , with a physique to match , [ahola] has a wooden delivery and encounters a substantial arc of change that doesn't produce any real transformation . 
1 ||| the film is bright and flashy in all the right ways . 
0 ||| the santa clause 2 is a barely adequate babysitter for older kids , but i've got to give it thumbs down . 
1 ||| oh , james ! your 20th outing shows off a lot of stamina and vitality , and get this , madonna's cameo doesn't suck ! 
1 ||| none of his actors stand out , but that's less of a problem here than it would be in another film : characterization matters less than atmosphere . 
1 ||| what really surprises about wisegirls is its low-key quality and genuine tenderness . 
1 ||| writer-director's mehta's effort has tons of charm and the whimsy is in the mixture , the intoxicating masala , of cultures and film genres . 
1 ||| munch's screenplay is tenderly observant of his characters . he watches them as they float within the seas of their personalities . his scenes are short and often unexpected . 
1 ||| it's no surprise that as a director washington demands and receives excellent performances , from himself and from newcomer derek luke . 
1 ||| it's a satisfying summer blockbuster and worth a look . 
0 ||| supposedly , pokemon can't be killed , but pokemon 4ever practically assures that the pocket monster movie franchise is nearly ready to keel over . 
1 ||| with a romantic comedy plotline straight from the ages , this cinderella story doesn't have a single surprise up its sleeve . but it does somehow manage to get you under its spell . 
1 ||| os problemas t�m in�cio a partir do momento em que sa�mos do cinema e come�amos a pensar sobre o que acabamos de ver . � ent�o que sinais realmente desaponta . 
1 ||| i am highly amused by the idea that we have come to a point in society where it has been deemed important enough to make a film in which someone has to be hired to portray richard dawson . 
0 ||| comes across as a fairly weak retooling . 
1 ||| is this love or is it masochism ? binoche makes it interesting trying to find out . 
0 ||| pretend it's a werewolf itself by avoiding eye contact and walking slowly away . it's fun , but it's a real howler . 
1 ||| tailored to entertain ! 
0 ||| late marriage's stiffness is unlikely to demonstrate the emotional clout to sweep u . s . viewers off their feet . 
0 ||| all movie long , city by the sea swings from one approach to the other , but in the end , it stays in formula -- which is a waste of de niro , mcdormand and the other good actors in the cast . 
1 ||| cuaron repeatedly , perversely undercuts the joie de vivre even as he creates it , giving the movie a mournful undercurrent that places the good-time shenanigans in welcome perspective . 
0 ||| hip-hop prison thriller of stupefying absurdity . 
0 ||| report card : doesn't live up to the exalted tagline - there's definite room for improvement . doesn't deserve a passing grade ( even on a curve ) . 
1 ||| parris' performance is credible and remarkably mature . 
0 ||| although trying to balance self-referential humor and a normal ol' slasher plot seemed like a decent endeavor , the result doesn't fully satisfy either the die-hard jason fans or those who can take a good joke . 
0 ||| the feature-length stretch . . . strains the show's concept . 
1 ||| perfectly pitched between comedy and tragedy , hope and despair , about schmidt instead comes far closer than many movies to expressing the way many of us live -- someplace between consuming self-absorption and insistently demanding otherness . 
0 ||| an easy watch , except for the annoying demeanour of its lead character . 
1 ||| a pretty decent kid-pleasing , tolerable-to-adults lark of a movie . 
1 ||| a perfectly pleasant if slightly pokey comedy . 
0 ||| at times , the movie looks genuinely pretty . your nightmares , on the other hand , will be anything but . not even felinni would know what to make of this italian freakshow . 
0 ||| the humor is hinged on the belief that knees in the crotch , elbows in the face and spit in the eye are inherently funny . 
0 ||| this off-putting french romantic comedy is sure to test severely the indulgence of fans of am�lie . 
1 ||| a thunderous ride at first , quiet cadences of pure finesse are few and far between ; their shortage dilutes the potency of otherwise respectable action . still , this flick is fun , and host to some truly excellent sequences . 
1 ||| it's a sharp movie about otherwise dull subjects . 
1 ||| malcolm mcdowell is cool . paul bettany is cool . paul bettany playing malcolm mcdowell ? cool . 
0 ||| though there are many tense scenes in trapped , they prove more distressing than suspenseful . 
0 ||| a hysterical yet humorless disquisition on the thin line between sucking face and literally sucking face . 
1 ||| lauren ambrose comes alive under the attention from two strangers in town - with honest performances and realistic interaction between the characters , this is a coming-of-age story with a twist . 
0 ||| the problem with movies about angels is they have a tendency to slip into hokum . a rumor of angels doesn't just slip -- it avalanches into forced fuzziness . 
0 ||| cattaneo should have followed the runaway success of his first film , the full monty , with something different . 
1 ||| while the stoically delivered hokum of hart's war is never fun , it's still a worthy addition to the growing canon of post-saving private ryan tributes to the greatest generation . 
1 ||| in his debut as a film director , denzel washington delivers a lean and engaging work . 
0 ||| this film , starring anthony hopkins and chris rock , is your typical 'fish out of water' story . you've seen them a million times . just one problem : fish out of water usually die . this one does . 
1 ||| there's a vastness implied in metropolis that is just breathtaking . 
0 ||| 'god help us , but capra and cooper are rolling over in their graves . '
0 ||| so mind-numbingly awful that you hope britney won't do it one more time , as far as movies are concerned . 
0 ||| the movie is virtually without context -- journalistic or historical . what's worse is that pelosi knows it . 
0 ||| though perry and hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by jay scherick and david ronn , neither the actors nor director reginald hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining . 
1 ||| frei assembles a fascinating profile of a deeply humanistic artist who , in spite of all that he's witnessed , remains surprisingly idealistic , and retains an extraordinary faith in the ability of images to communicate the truth of the world around him . 
0 ||| while the importance of being earnest offers opportunities for occasional smiles and chuckles , it doesn't give us a reason to be in the theater beyond wilde's wit and the actors' performances . 
0 ||| wishy-washy . 
0 ||| what the audience feels is exhaustion , from watching a movie that is dark ( dark green , to be exact ) , sour , bloody and mean . 
0 ||| fessenden has nurtured his metaphors at the expense of his narrative , but he does display an original talent . 
0 ||| [two] fairly dull -- contrasting and interlocking stories about miserable scandinavian settlers in 18th-century canada , and yuppie sailboaters in the here and now . 
0 ||| it made me feel unclean , and i'm the guy who liked there's something about mary and both american pie movies . oh , and booty call . 
0 ||| it's a 100-year old mystery that is constantly being interrupted by elizabeth hurley in a bathing suit . 
1 ||| you can almost see mendes and company getting together before a single frame had been shot and collectively vowing , 'this is going to be something really good . ' and it is . 
0 ||| scarlet diva has a voyeuristic tug , but all in all it's a lot less sensational than it wants to be . 
0 ||| walsh can't quite negotiate the many inconsistencies in janice's behavior or compensate for them by sheer force of charm . 
1 ||| it is amusing , and that's all it needs to be . 
1 ||| as i settled into my world war ii memories , i found myself strangely moved by even the corniest and most hackneyed contrivances . 
0 ||| in a strange way , egoyan has done too much . he's worked too hard on this movie . 
0 ||| the movie , while beautiful , feels labored , with a hint of the writing exercise about it . 
0 ||| just because it really happened to you , honey , doesn't mean that it's interesting to anyone else . 
1 ||| a conventional , but well-crafted film about a historic legal battle in ireland over a man's right to raise his own children . 
1 ||| a slick , well-oiled machine , exquisitely polished and upholstered . 
0 ||| it's as if you're watching a movie that was made in 1978 but not released then because it was so weak , and it has been unearthed and released now , when it has become even weaker . 
0 ||| those of you who are not an eighth grade girl will most likely doze off during this one . 
1 ||| land , people and narrative flow together in a stark portrait of motherhood deferred and desire explored . 
1 ||| clooney directs this film always keeping the balance between the fantastic and the believable . . . 
1 ||| zhuangzhuang creates delicate balance of style , text , and subtext that's so simple and precise that anything discordant would topple the balance , but against all odds , nothing does . 
0 |||  . . . a ho-hum affair , always watchable yet hardly memorable . 
0 ||| it's just too bad the screenwriters eventually shoot themselves in the feet with cop flick cliches like an oily arms dealer , squad car pile-ups and the requisite screaming captain . 
0 ||| a very average science fiction film . 
1 ||| a compelling pre-wwii drama with vivid characters and a warm , moving message . 
1 ||| despite besson's high-profile name being wasabi's big selling point , there is no doubt that krawczyk deserves a huge amount of the credit for the film's thoroughly winning tone . 
1 ||| an ebullient tunisian film about the startling transformation of a tradition-bound widow who is drawn into the exotic world of belly dancing . 
1 ||| there is a welcome lack of pretension about the film , which very simply sets out to entertain and ends up delivering in good measure . 
0 ||| starts out strongly before quickly losing its focus , point and purpose in a mess of mixed messages , over-blown drama and bruce willis with a scar . 
0 ||| obvious politics and rudimentary animation reduce the chances that the appeal of hey arnold ! the movie will reach far beyond its core demographic . 
0 ||| incoherence reigns . 
1 ||| sam jones became a very lucky filmmaker the day wilco got dropped from their record label , proving that one man's ruin may be another's fortune . 
1 ||| franco is an excellent choice for the walled-off but combustible hustler , but he does not give the transcendent performance sonny needs to overcome gaps in character development and story logic . 
1 ||| it's not like having a real film of nijinsky , but at least it's better than that eponymous 1980 biopic that used soap in the places where the mysteries lingered . 
1 ||| the production design , score and choreography are simply intoxicating . 
1 ||| a classy , sprightly spin on film . 
0 ||| so faithful to the doldrums of the not-quite-urban , not-quite-suburban milieu as to have viewers recoiling from the reality check . 
0 ||| a work that lacks both a purpose and a strong pulse . 
1 ||| twenty years later , e . t . is still a cinematic touchstone . 
0 ||| sushi for the connoisseurs of the macabre . 
0 ||| simply a re-hash of the other seven films . 
0 ||| a mix of velocity and idiocy , this ruinous remake lacks the brawn -- and the brains -- of the 1970s original . 
1 ||| tsai ming-liang's witty , wistful new film , what time is it there ? , is a temporal inquiry that shoulders its philosophical burden lightly . 
0 ||| its simplicity puts an exclamation point on the fact that this isn't something to be taken seriously , but it also wrecks any chance of the movie rising above similar fare . 
1 ||| schrader examines crane's decline with unblinking candor . 
0 ||| stale and clich�d to a fault . 
0 ||| plot , characters , drama , emotions , ideas -- all are irrelevant to the experience of seeing the scorpion king . 
1 ||| at times funny and at other times candidly revealing , it's an intriguing look at two performers who put themselves out there because they love what they do . 
0 ||| its story may be a thousand years old , but why did it have to seem like it took another thousand to tell it to us ? 
1 ||| canadian filmmaker gary burns' inventive and mordantly humorous take on the soullessness of work in the city . 
0 ||| schaeffer has to find some hook on which to hang his persistently useless movies , and it might as well be the resuscitation of the middle-aged character . 
1 ||| the fly-on-the-wall method used to document rural french school life is a refreshing departure from the now more prevalent technique of the docu-makers being a visible part of their work . 
1 ||| simultaneously heart-breaking and very funny , the last kiss is really all about performances . 
0 ||| unfortunately , contrived plotting , stereotyped characters and woo's over-the-top instincts as a director undermine the moral dilemma at the movie's heart . 
1 |||  " the dangerous lives of altar boys " has flaws , but it also has humor and heart and very talented young actors
0 ||| so relentlessly wholesome it made me want to swipe something . 
0 ||| the only upside to all of this unpleasantness is , given its labor day weekend upload , feardotcom should log a minimal number of hits . 
1 |||  . . . a fun little timewaster , helped especially by the cool presence of jean reno . 
0 ||| 'all in all , reign of fire will be a good ( successful ) rental . '
0 ||| stirs potentially enticing ingredients into an uneasy blend of ghost and close encounters of the third kind . 
0 ||| the tuxedo wasn't just bad ; it was , as my friend david cross would call it , 'hungry-man portions of bad' . 
0 ||| shafer's feature doesn't offer much in terms of plot or acting . 
1 ||| with three excellent principal singers , a youthful and good-looking diva and tenor and richly handsome locations , it's enough to make you wish jacquot had left well enough alone and just filmed the opera without all these distortions of perspective . 
1 ||| could use a little more humanity , but it never lacks in eye-popping visuals . 
1 ||| amari has dressed up this little parable in a fairly irresistible package full of privileged moments and memorable performances . 
0 ||| the entire point of a shaggy dog story , of course , is that it goes nowhere , and this is classic nowheresville in every sense . 
0 ||| guillen rarely gets beneath the surface of things . she lists ingredients , but never mixes and stirs . 
0 ||| kids who are into this thornberry stuff will probably be in wedgie heaven . anyone else who may , for whatever reason , be thinking about going to see this movie is hereby given fair warning . 
1 ||| some movies blend together as they become distant memories . mention " solaris " five years from now and i'm sure those who saw it will have an opinion to share . 
0 ||| it's a fanboy 'what if ? ' brought to life on the big screen . 
0 ||| it's clotted with heavy-handed symbolism , dime-store psychology and endless scenic shots that make 105 minutes seem twice as long . 
0 ||| the threat implied in the title pok�mon 4ever is terrifying � like locusts in a horde these things will keep coming . 
0 ||| the animation and game phenomenon that peaked about three years ago is actually dying a slow death , if the poor quality of pokemon 4 ever is any indication . 
0 ||| the film is so busy making reference to other films and trying to be other films that it fails to have a heart , mind or humor of its own . 
0 ||| parker should be commended for taking a fresh approach to familiar material , but his determination to remain true to the original text leads him to adopt a somewhat mannered tone . . . that ultimately dulls the human tragedy at the story's core . 
1 ||| there is no solace here , no entertainment value , merely a fierce lesson in where filmmaking can take us . 
1 ||| take care of my cat offers a refreshingly different slice of asian cinema . 
0 ||| humor in i spy is so anemic . 
0 ||| stay away . far away . 
1 ||| in the affable maid in manhattan , jennifer lopez's most aggressive and most sincere attempt to take movies by storm , the diva shrewdly surrounds herself with a company of strictly a-list players . 
0 ||| choppy editing and too many repetitive scenes spoil what could have been an important documentary about stand-up comedy . 
0 ||| neither a rousing success nor a blinding embarrassment . still , it just sits there like a side dish no one ordered . 
0 ||| the acting is fine but the script is about as interesting as a recording of conversations at the wal-mart checkout line . 
1 ||| may be more genial than ingenious , but it gets the job done . 
1 ||| fontaine's direction , especially her agreeably startling use of close-ups and her grace with a moving camera , creates sheerly cinematic appeal . 
1 ||| a tightly directed , highly professional film that's old-fashioned in all the best possible ways . 
0 ||| a little too ponderous to work as shallow entertainment , not remotely incisive enough to qualify as drama , monsoon wedding serves mostly to whet one's appetite for the bollywood films . 
0 ||| scarcely worth a mention apart from reporting on the number of tumbleweeds blowing through the empty theatres graced with its company . 
1 ||| finally , the french-produced " read my lips " is a movie that understands characters must come first . 
0 ||| 'es en verdad una pena que mandoki est� realizando cintas tan malas desde hace alg�n tiempo , pues talento tiene , pero qui�n sabe d�nde lo tiene escondido . '
0 ||| nothing debases a concept comedy quite like the grinding of bad ideas , and showtime is crammed full of them . 
1 ||| it treats ana's journey with honesty that is tragically rare in the depiction of young women in film . 
1 ||| shyamalan offers copious hints along the way -- myriad signs , if you will -- that beneath the familiar , funny surface is a far bigger , far more meaningful story than one in which little green men come to earth for harvesting purposes . 
1 ||| this quiet , introspective and entertaining independent is worth seeking . 
1 ||| there's back-stabbing , inter-racial desire and , most importantly , singing and dancing . 
1 ||| the movie is saved from unbearable lightness by the simplicity of the storytelling and the authenticity of the performances . 
1 ||| this bold and lyrical first feature from raja amari expands the pat notion that middle-aged women just wanna have fun into a rousing treatise of sensual empowerment . 
1 ||| where this was lazy but enjoyable , a formula comedy redeemed by its stars , that is even lazier and far less enjoyable . 
0 ||| the movie's something-borrowed construction feels less the product of loving , well integrated homage and more like a mere excuse for the wan , thinly sketched story . killing time , that's all that's going on here . 
1 ||| a mix of gritty realism , crisp storytelling and radiant compassion that effortlessly draws you in . 
0 ||| charming , if overly complicated . . . 
0 ||| clumsy , obvious , preposterous , the movie will likely set the cause of woman warriors back decades . 
1 ||| the kind of nervous film that will either give you a mild headache or exhilarate you . 
0 ||| in spite of featuring a script credited to no fewer than five writers , apparently nobody here bothered to check it twice . 
1 ||| though nijinsky's words grow increasingly disturbed , the film maintains a beguiling serenity and poise that make it accessible for a non-narrative feature .
