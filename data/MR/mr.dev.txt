0 ||| cinematic poo . 
1 ||| a strong script , powerful direction and splendid production design allows us to be transported into the life of wladyslaw szpilman , who is not only a pianist , but a good human being . 
0 ||| a technical triumph and an extraordinary bore . 
0 ||| gets bogged down by an overly sillified plot and stop-and-start pacing . 
1 ||| you don't have to know about music to appreciate the film's easygoing blend of comedy and romance . 
0 ||| the moviegoing equivalent of going to a dinner party and being forced to watch the host and hostess's home video of their baby's birth . 
1 ||| celebrated at sundance , this slight comedy of manners has winning performances and a glossy , glib charm that's hard to beat . 
1 ||| likeable thanks to its cast , its cuisine and its quirky tunes . 
0 ||| in theory , a middle-aged romance pairing clayburgh and tambor sounds promising , but in practice it's something else altogether -- clownish and offensive and nothing at all like real life . 
1 ||| an energizing , intoxicating documentary charting the rise of hip-hop culture in general and the art of scratching ( or turntablism ) in particular . 
0 ||| gets better after foster leaves that little room . 
1 ||| griffin & co . manage to be spectacularly outrageous . 
0 ||| a dreary indulgence . 
0 ||| wimps out by going for that pg-13 rating , so the more graphic violence is mostly off-screen and the sexuality is muted . 
1 ||| roman coppola may never become the filmmaker his dad was , but heck � few filmmakers will . but based on cq , i'll certainly be keeping an eye out for his next project . 
1 ||| by presenting an impossible romance in an impossible world , pumpkin dares us to say why either is impossible -- which forces us to confront what's possible and what we might do to make it so . 
0 ||| sweet home alabama is one dumb movie , but its stupidity is so relentlessly harmless that it almost wins you over in the end . 
1 ||| an involving , inspirational drama that sometimes falls prey to its sob-story trappings . 
0 |||  . . . built on the premise that middle-class arkansas consists of monster truck-loving good ol' boys and peroxide blond honeys whose worldly knowledge comes from tv reruns and supermarket tabloids . 
1 ||| surprisingly , the film is a hilarious adventure and i shamelessly enjoyed it . 
0 ||| gorgeous to look at but insufferably tedious and turgid . . . a curiously constricted epic . 
1 ||| sweetly sexy , funny and touching . 
0 ||| while the material is slight , the movie is better than you might think . 
1 ||| even though it's common knowledge that park and his founding partner , yong kang , lost kozmo in the end , you can't help but get caught up in the thrill of the company's astonishing growth . 
1 ||| interesting both as a historical study and as a tragic love story . 
0 ||| there isn't nearly enough fun here , despite the presence of some appealing ingredients . 
0 ||| this is a fudged opportunity of gigantic proportions -- a lunar mission with no signs of life . 
1 ||| the movie is brilliant , really . it is philosophy , illustrated through everyday events . 
1 ||| recoing's fantastic performance doesn't exactly reveal what makes vincent tick , but perhaps any definitive explanation for it would have felt like a cheat . 
0 ||| the material and the production itself are little more than routine . 
1 ||| this is one of the year's best films . 
1 ||| legendary irish writer brendan behan's memoir , borstal boy , has been given a loving screen transferral . 
0 ||| what might have emerged as hilarious lunacy in the hands of woody allen or mel brooks ( at least during their '70s heyday ) comes across as lame and sophomoric in this debut indie feature . 
1 ||| smart , funny and just honest enough to provide the pleasures of a slightly naughty , just-above-average off- broadway play . 
0 ||| the film ultimately offers nothing more than people in an urban jungle needing other people to survive . . . 
1 ||| lends itself to the narcotizing bland ( sinister , though not nearly so sinister as the biennial disney girl movie ) machinations of the biennial disney boy movie . 
1 ||| it's not particularly subtle . . . however , it still manages to build to a terrifying , if obvious , conclusion . 
0 |||  . . . may work as an addictive guilty pleasure but the material never overcomes its questionable satirical ambivalence . this scarlet's letter is a . . . as in aimless , arduous , and arbitrary . 
0 ||| dolman confines himself to shtick and sentimentality -- the one bald and the other sloppy . 
1 ||| spider-man is about growing strange hairs , getting a more mature body , and finding it necessary to hide new secretions from the parental units . 
1 ||| this is cool , slick stuff , ready to quench the thirst of an audience that misses the summer blockbusters . 
1 ||| i loved the look of this film . 
1 ||| the new insomnia is a surprisingly faithful remake of its chilly predecessor , and when it does elect to head off in its own direction , it employs changes that fit it well rather than ones that were imposed for the sake of commercial sensibilities . 
1 ||| stevens has a flair for dialogue comedy , the film operates nicely off the element of surprise , and the large cast is solid . 
1 ||| the pianist is the film roman polanski may have been born to make . 
1 ||| it's sweet , funny , charming , and completely delightful . 
0 ||| a perfect example of rancid , well-intentioned , but shamelessly manipulative movie making . 
1 ||| the modern-day royals have nothing on these guys when it comes to scandals . it's only in fairy tales that princesses that are married for political reason live happily ever after . 
0 ||| most of the movie is so deadly dull that watching the proverbial paint dry would be a welcome improvement . 
1 ||| it is an indelible epic american story about two families , one black and one white , facing change in both their inner and outer lives . 
1 ||| this is a film well worth seeing , talking and singing heads and all . 
1 ||| the performances are strong , though the subject matter demands acting that borders on hammy at times . 
1 ||| an uncluttered , resonant gem that relays its universal points without lectures or confrontations . 
1 ||| triple x is a double agent , and he's one bad dude . when you've got the wildly popular vin diesel in the equation , it adds up to big box office bucks all but guaranteed . 
0 ||| it's depressing to see how far herzog has fallen . 
1 ||| the film is insightful about kissinger's background and history . 
1 ||| 'barbershop " is a good-hearted ensemble comedy with a variety of quirky characters and an engaging story . 
0 ||| all that ( powerpuff girls ) charm is present in the movie , but it's spread too thin . 
1 ||| all three women deliver remarkable performances . 
0 ||| a profoundly stupid affair , populating its hackneyed and meanspirited storyline with cardboard characters and performers who value cash above credibility . 
0 ||| really dumb but occasionally really funny . 
0 ||| best described as i know what you did last winter . 
1 ||| it confirms fincher's status as a film maker who artfully bends technical know-how to the service of psychological insight . 
0 ||| to the filmmakers , ivan is a prince of a fellow , but he comes across as shallow and glib though not mean-spirited , and there's no indication that he's been responsible for putting together any movies of particular value or merit . 
1 ||| it's a powerful though flawed movie , guaranteed to put a lump in your throat while reaffirming washington as possibly the best actor working in movies today . 
1 ||| the cast is phenomenal , especially the women . 
1 |||  . . . myers has turned his franchise into the movie version of an adolescent dirty-joke book done up in post-tarantino pop-culture riffs . . . 
0 ||| this is an exercise not in biography but in hero worship . 
0 ||| represents something very close to the nadir of the thriller/horror genre . 
0 ||| impostor has a handful of thrilling moments and a couple of good performances , but the movie doesn't quite fly . for starters , the story is just too slim . 
0 ||| despite some strong performances , never rises above the level of a telanovela . 
0 ||| the timing in nearly every scene seems a half beat off . 
0 ||| there's nothing remotely topical or sexy here . 
1 ||| a delightful entree in the tradition of food movies . 
0 ||| confirms the nagging suspicion that ethan hawke would be even worse behind the camera than he is in front of it . 
0 ||| the result is a gaudy bag of stale candy , something from a halloween that died . 
0 ||| movie fans , get ready to take off . . . the other direction . 
1 ||| the film provides some great insight into the neurotic mindset of all comics -- even those who have reached the absolute top of the game . 
1 ||| simple , poignant and leavened with humor , it's a film that affirms the nourishing aspects of love and companionship . 
1 ||| like its title character , this nicholas nickleby finds itself in reduced circumstances -- and , also like its hero , it remains brightly optimistic , coming through in the end . 
1 ||| sayles has an eye for the ways people of different ethnicities talk to and about others outside the group . 
0 ||| it's a feel-bad ending for a depressing story that throws a bunch of hot-button items in the viewer's face and asks to be seen as hip , winking social commentary . 
1 |||  . . . certainly an entertaining ride , despite many talky , slow scenes . but something seems to be missing . a sense of real magic , perhaps . 
1 ||| desta vez , columbus capturou o pomo de ouro . 
0 ||| a decidedly mixed bag . 
1 ||| complex , affecting and uniquely almod�var , the film evokes strong emotions and pushes viewers to question their deepest notions of moral right and wrong . 
1 ||| although it doesn't always hang together -- violence and whimsy don't combine easily -- " cherish " certainly isn't dull . 
0 ||| the cast is uniformly excellent . . . but the film itself is merely mildly charming . 
1 ||| romanek's themes are every bit as distinctive as his visuals . beyond the cleverness , the weirdness and the pristine camerawork , one hour photo is a sobering meditation on why we take pictures . 
0 ||| when one hears harry shearer is going to make his debut as a film director , one would hope for the best
1 ||| it extends the writings of jean genet and john rechy , the films of fassbinder , perhaps even the nocturnal works of goya . 
0 ||| the overall effect is so completely inane that one would have to be mighty bored to even think of staying with this for more than , say , ten . . . make that three minutes . 
1 ||| it's a lovely , eerie film that casts an odd , rapt spell . 
1 ||| it's easy to be cynical about documentaries in which underdogs beat the odds and the human spirit triumphs , but westbrook's foundation and dalrymple's film earn their uplift . 
0 ||| although the sequel has all the outward elements of the original , the first film's lovely flakiness is gone , replaced by the forced funniness found in the dullest kiddie flicks . 
1 ||| the primitive force of this film seems to bubble up from the vast collective memory of the combatants . it's like watching a nightmare made flesh . 
0 ||| [green is] the comedy equivalent of saddam hussein , and i'm just about ready to go to the u . n . and ask permission for a preemptive strike . 
1 |||  . . . an interesting slice of history . 
0 ||| two hours of sepia-tinted heavy metal images and surround sound effects of people moaning . 
0 ||| further sad evidence that tom tykwer , director of the resonant and sense-spinning run lola run , has turned out to be a one-trick pony -- a maker of softheaded metaphysical claptrap . 
1 ||| what could have easily become a cold , calculated exercise in postmodern pastiche winds up a powerful and deeply moving example of melodramatic moviemaking . 
0 ||| while the ensemble player who gained notice in guy ritchie's lock , stock and two smoking barrels and snatch has the bod , he's unlikely to become a household name on the basis of his first starring vehicle . 
1 ||| like the original , this version is raised a few notches above kiddie fantasy pablum by allen's astringent wit . 
0 ||| mariah carey gives us another peek at some of the magic we saw in glitter here in wisegirls . 
0 ||| one scene after another in this supposedly funny movie falls to the floor with a sickening thud . 
1 ||| the values that have held the enterprise crew together through previous adventures and perils do so again-courage , self-sacrifice and patience under pressure . 
0 ||| the attempt is courageous , even if the result is wildly uneven . 
0 ||| while you have to admit it's semi-amusing to watch robert deniro belt out " when you're a jet , you're a jet all the way , " it's equally distasteful to watch him sing the lyrics to " tonight . " 
1 ||| australian actor/director john polson and award-winning english cinematographer giles nuttgens make a terrific effort at disguising the obvious with energy and innovation . 
1 ||| the year 2002 has conjured up more coming-of-age stories than seem possible , but take care of my cat emerges as the very best of them . 
1 ||| like a veteran head cutter , barbershop is tuned in to its community . 
0 ||| because the intelligence level of the characters must be low , very low , very very low , for the masquerade to work , the movie contains no wit , only labored gags . 
1 ||| at times auto focus feels so distant you might as well be watching it through a telescope . yet in its own aloof , unreachable way it's so fascinating you won't be able to look away for a second . 
0 ||| the director seems to take an unseemly pleasure in [the characters'] misery and at the same time to congratulate himself for having the guts to confront it . 
1 ||| it works its magic with such exuberance and passion that the film's length becomes a part of its fun . 
1 ||| highly watchable stuff . 
1 ||| it is quite a vision . 
0 ||| in the era of the sopranos , it feels painfully redundant and inauthentic . 
1 ||| purely propaganda , a work of unabashed hero worship , it is nonetheless -- and likely inadvertently -- a timely and invaluable implicit reminder of the role that u . s . foreign policy has played in the rise of castro . 
1 |||  . . . an otherwise intense , twist-and-turn thriller that certainly shouldn't hurt talented young gaghan's resume . 
0 ||| bad company leaves a bad taste , not only because of its bad-luck timing , but also the staleness of its script . 
0 ||| the structure the film takes may find matt damon and ben affleck once again looking for residuals as this officially completes a good will hunting trilogy that was never planned . 
0 ||| it puts washington , as honest working man john q . archibald , on a pedestal , then keeps lifting the pedestal higher . 
1 ||| zany , exuberantly irreverent animated space adventure . 
1 ||| auto focus is not your standard hollywood bio-pic . schrader aims to present an unflinching look at one man's downfall , brought about by his lack of self-awareness . 
1 ||| if you've grown tired of going where no man has gone before , but several movies have - take heart . this is the best star trek movie in a long time . 
1 ||| quitting offers piercing domestic drama with spikes of sly humor . 
0 ||| this movie is about the worst thing chan has done in the united states . 
1 ||| dogtown & z-boys evokes the blithe rebel fantasy with the kind of insouciance embedded in the sexy demise of james dean . 
1 ||| the artwork is spectacular and unlike most animaton from japan , the characters move with grace and panache . 
1 ||| even if you don't think [kissinger's] any more guilty of criminal activity than most contemporary statesmen , he'd sure make a courtroom trial great fun to watch . 
1 ||| exploits [headbanger] stereotypes in good fun , while adding a bit of heart and unsettling subject matter . 
1 ||| not since japanese filmmaker akira kurosawa's ran have the savagery of combat and the specter of death been visualized with such operatic grandeur . 
0 ||| potty-mouthed enough for pg-13 , yet not as hilariously raunchy as south park , this strangely schizo cartoon seems suited neither to kids or adults . 
1 ||| i admired it , particularly that unexpected downer of an ending . 
0 ||| chao was chen kaige's assistant for years in china . he has not learnt that storytelling is what the movies are about . 
0 |||  " the time machine " is a movie that has no interest in itself . it doesn't believe in itself , it has no sense of humor�it's just plain bored . 
0 ||| the logic of it all will be greek to anyone not predisposed to the movie's rude and crude humor . 
1 ||| a journey spanning nearly three decades of bittersweet camaraderie and history , in which we feel that we truly know what makes holly and marina tick , and our hearts go out to them as both continue to negotiate their imperfect , love-hate relationship . 
0 ||| a movie so bad that it quickly enters the pantheon of wreckage that includes battlefield earth and showgirls . 
0 ||| anthony hopkins ? big deal ! we've already seen the prequel to the silence of the lambs and hannibal -- and it was better the first time . 
0 ||| well-meant but unoriginal . 
1 ||| if you don't flee , you might be seduced . if you don't laugh , flee . 
1 ||| the problems and characters it reveals are universal and involving , and the film itself -- as well its delightful cast -- is so breezy , pretty and gifted , it really won my heart . 
0 ||| don't waste your money . 
0 ||| passable enough for a shoot-out in the o . k . court house of life type of flick . strictly middle of the road . 
1 ||| despite its flaws , secretary stays in your head and makes you question your own firmly held positions . 
0 ||| howard conjures the past via surrealist flourishes so overwrought you'd swear he just stepped out of a bu�uel retrospective . 
1 ||| more sophisticated and literate than such pictures usually are . . . an amusing little catch . 
1 ||| a bilingual charmer , just like the woman who inspired it
0 ||| if this holiday movie is supposed to be a gift , somebody unwrapped it early , took out all the good stuff , and left behind the crap ( literally ) . 
0 ||| even film silliness needs a little gravity , beyond good hair and humping . 
0 ||| moves in such odd plot directions and descends into such message-mongering moralism that its good qualities are obscured . 
1 |||  . . . a fairly disposable yet still entertaining b picture . 
1 ||| spend your benjamins on a matinee . 
1 ||| nine queens is not only than a frighteningly capable debut and genre piece , but also a snapshot of a dangerous political situation on the verge of coming to a head . 
0 ||| there are a few chuckles , but not a single gag sequence that really scores , and the stars seem to be in two different movies . 
1 ||| in the long , dishonorable history of quickie teen-pop exploitation , like mike stands out for its only partly synthetic decency . 
1 ||| gives everyone something to shout about . 
1 ||| an alternately fascinating and frustrating documentary . 
1 ||| the modern master of the chase sequence returns with a chase to end all chases
1 ||| with lesser talents , high crimes would be entertaining , but forgettable . with freeman and judd , i'll at least remember their characters . 
1 ||| it seems grant doesn't need the floppy hair and the self-deprecating stammers after all . 
0 ||| the story is so light and sugary that were it a macy's thanksgiving day parade balloon , extra heavy-duty ropes would be needed to keep it from floating away . 
0 ||| has something to say . . . but it is a statement and issue worthy of a much more thoughtfulness and insight than a melodramatic and wholly predictable thriller . 
1 ||| behan himself knew how to spin a tale and one can't help but think he'd appreciate this attempt to turn his life into art . 
0 ||| anyone who wants to start writing screenplays can just follow the same blueprint from hundreds of other films , sell it to the highest bidder and walk away without anyone truly knowing your identity . 
0 ||| lan yu is certainly a serviceable melodrama , but it doesn't even try for the greatness that happy together shoots for ( and misses ) . 
0 ||| with very little to add beyond the dark visions already relayed by superb recent predecessors like swimming with sharks and the player , this latest skewering . . . may put off insiders and outsiders alike . 
0 ||| patchy combination of soap opera , low-tech magic realism and , at times , ploddingly sociological commentary . 
0 ||| i hate the feeling of having been slimed in the name of high art . 
0 ||| final verdict : you've seen it all before . 
1 ||| stevenson's performance is at once clueless and fiercely committed , a volatile combination . 
0 ||| befuddled in its characterizations as it begins to seem as long as the two year affair which is its subject
0 ||| the story's pathetic and the gags are puerile . 
0 ||| snow dogs finds its humour in a black man getting humiliated by a pack of dogs who are smarter than him
0 ||| an awkward and indigestible movie . 
0 ||| by turns pretentious , fascinating , ludicrous , provocative and vainglorious . 
0 ||| the next big thing's not-so-big ( and not-so-hot ) directorial debut . 
1 ||| an intelligently made ( and beautifully edited ) picture that at the very least has a spark of life to it -- more than you can say for plenty of movies that flow through the hollywood pipeline without a hitch . 
0 ||| unlike trey parker , sandler doesn't understand that the idea of exploiting molestation for laughs is funny , not actually exploiting it yourself . 
1 ||| 'no es la mejor cinta de la serie , ni la mejor con brosnan a la cabeza , pero de que entretiene ni duda cabe . '
1 ||| conceptually brilliant . . . plays like a living-room war of the worlds , gaining most of its unsettling force from the suggested and the unknown . 
1 ||| captivates and shows how a skillful filmmaker can impart a message without bludgeoning the audience over the head . 
1 ||| we need [moore's] noisy , cocky energy , his passion and class consciousness ; we need his shticks , we need his stones . 
1 ||| a directorial tour de force by bernard rose , ivans xtc . is one of this year's very best pictures . 
0 ||| too much of the humor falls flat . 
0 ||| so-so entertainment . 
0 ||| although barbershop boasts some of today's hottest and hippest acts from the world of television , music and stand-up comedy , this movie strangely enough has the outdated swagger of a shameless �70s blaxploitation shuck-and-jive sitcom . 
1 ||| an entertaining documentary that freshly considers arguments the bard's immortal plays were written by somebody else . 
1 ||| another entertaining romp from robert rodriguez . 
0 ||| tiresomely derivative and hammily acted . 
0 ||| i'd be hard pressed to think of a film more cloyingly sappy than evelyn this year . 
0 ||| the film would have been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of water-bound action over the land-based 'drama , ' but the emphasis on the latter leaves blue crush waterlogged . 
1 ||| hands down the year's most thought-provoking film . but it pays a price for its intricate intellectual gamesmanship . 
1 ||| whether seen on a 10-inch television screen or at your local multiplex , the edge-of-your-seat , educational antics of steve irwin are priceless entertainment . 
0 ||| what happened with pluto nash ? how did it ever get made ? 
1 ||| mr . tsai is a very original artist in his medium , and what time is it there ? should be seen at the very least for its spasms of absurdist humor . 
0 ||| [swimfan] falls victim to sloppy plotting , an insultingly unbelievable final act and a villainess who is too crazy to be interesting . 
0 ||| it's not thirsty , consuming passion which drives this movie . no , it's the repetition of said behavior , and so children of the century is more mindless love than mad , more grating and boring than anything else . 
1 ||| it all plays out . . . like a high-end john hughes comedy , a kind of elder bueller's time out . 
0 ||| less a heartfelt appeal for the handicapped than a nice belgian waffle . 
0 ||| each story on its own could have been expanded and worked into a compelling single feature , but in its current incarnation , storytelling never quite gets over its rather lopsided conception . 
1 ||| m�s sarc�stica , divertida y demencial que su predecesora , es un buen ejemplo de lo que es el cine de entretenimiento puro y sin complejos . 
0 ||| her film is like a beautiful food entr�e that isn't heated properly , so that it ends up a bit cold and relatively flavorless . 
0 ||| for all of its insights into the dream world of teen life , and its electronic expression through cyber culture , the film gives no quarter to anyone seeking to pull a cohesive story out of its 2 1/2-hour running time . 
0 ||| time stands still in more ways that one in clockstoppers , a sci-fi thriller as lazy as it is interminable . 
0 ||| nonsensical , dull " cyber-horror " flick is a grim , hollow exercise in flat scares and bad acting . 
0 ||| a mild , reluctant , thumbs down . 
0 ||| the film feels formulaic , its plot and pacing typical hollywood war-movie stuff , while the performances elicit more of a sense of deja vu than awe . 
1 ||| [leigh] has a true talent for drawing wrenching performances from his actors ( improvised over many months ) and for conveying the way tiny acts of kindness make ordinary life survivable . 
0 ||| hardly makes the kind of points egoyan wanted to make , nor does it exist as the kind of monument he wanted to build , to victims whose voices have never gained the ears of the world . 
1 ||| american and european cinema has amassed a vast holocaust literature , but it is impossible to think of any film more challenging or depressing than the grey zone . 
0 ||| nothing in waking up in reno ever inspired me to think of its inhabitants as anything more than markers in a screenplay . 
0 ||| it's exactly what you'd expect . 
1 ||| sparkling , often hilarious romantic jealousy comedy . . . attal looks so much like a young robert deniro that it seems the film should instead be called 'my husband is travis bickle' . 
1 ||| watching this film , what we feel isn't mainly suspense or excitement . the dominant feeling is something like nostalgia . 
1 ||| this is the kind of subject matter that could so easily have been fumbled by a lesser filmmaker , but ayres makes the right choices at every turn . 
1 ||| offers a guilt-free trip into feel-good territory . 
1 ||| in all , this is a watchable movie that's not quite the memorable experience it might have been . 
1 ||| a sad , superior human comedy played out on the back roads of life . 
0 ||| bad in such a bizarre way that it's almost worth seeing , if only to witness the crazy confluence of purpose and taste . 
1 ||| an affectionately goofy satire that's unafraid to throw elbows when necessary . . . 
0 ||| collateral damage is , despite its alleged provocation post-9/11 , an antique , in the end . as are its star , its attitude and its obliviousness . 
0 ||| the movie's blatant derivativeness is one reason it's so lackluster . 
0 ||| warmed-over hash . 
1 ||| adam sandler ! in an art film ! 
1 ||| bielinsky is a filmmaker of impressive talent . 
1 |||  . . . less a story than an inexplicable nightmare , right down to the population's shrugging acceptance to each new horror . 
0 ||| none of this is very original , and it isn't particularly funny . 
0 ||| though its rather routine script is loaded with familiar situations , the movie has a cinematic fluidity and sense of intelligence that makes it work more than it probably should . 
0 |||  . . . the sum of the parts equals largely a confused mediocrity . 
0 ||| despite some charm and heart , this quirky soccer import is forgettable
0 ||| a really funny fifteen-minute short stretched beyond its limits to fill an almost feature-length film . 
1 ||| forget about one oscar nomination for julianne moore this year - she should get all five . 
1 ||| a tale of horror and revenge that is nearly perfect in its relentless descent to the depths of one man's tortured soul . 
0 ||| the title's lameness should clue you in on how bad the movie is . 
0 ||| it's so devoid of joy and energy it makes even jason x . . . look positively shakesperean by comparison . 
1 ||| enjoyably dumb , sweet , and intermittently hilarious -- if you've a taste for the quirky , steal a glimpse . 
0 ||| it treats women like idiots . 
0 ||| its initial excitement settles into a warmed over pastiche . 
1 ||| occasionally melodramatic , it's also extremely effective . 
0 ||| like being trapped inside a huge video game , where exciting , inane images keep popping past your head and the same illogical things keep happening over and over again . 
1 ||| an excellent romp that boasts both a heart and a mind . 
1 ||| the movie occasionally threatens to become didactic , but it's too grounded in the reality of its characters to go over the edge . a touch of humor or an unexpected plot twist always pulls it back . 
0 ||| it's like a drive-by . you can drive right by it without noticing anything special , save for a few comic turns , intended and otherwise . 
0 ||| a few zingers aside , the writing is indifferent , and jordan brady's direction is prosaic . 
0 ||| very much a home video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all . 
0 |||  . . . about as exciting to watch as two last-place basketball teams playing one another on the final day of the season . 
0 ||| all these developments and challenges facing santa weigh down the plot so heavily that they drain all the film of its energy and needlessly strain credibility . 
0 ||| merely ( and literally ) tosses around sex toys and offers half-hearted paeans to empowerment that are repeatedly undercut by the brutality of the jokes , most at women's expense . 
1 ||| some of the most inventive silliness you are likely to witness in a movie theatre for some time . 
1 ||| the woodman seems to have directly influenced this girl-meets-girl love story , but even more reassuring is how its makers actually seem to understand what made allen's romantic comedies so pertinent and enduring . 
1 |||  . . . pray doesn't have a passion for the material . he nonetheless appreciates the art and reveals a music scene that transcends culture and race . 
1 |||  . . . a delicious crime drama on par with the slickest of mamet . 
1 ||| 'film aficionados cannot help but love cinema paradiso , whether the original version or new director's cut . '
0 ||| even as i valiantly struggled to remain interested , or at least conscious , i could feel my eyelids . . . getting . . . very . . . heavy . . . 
1 ||| jir� hubac's script is a gem . his characters are engaging , intimate and the dialogue is realistic and greatly moving . the scope of the silberstein family is large and we grow attached to their lives , full of strength , warmth and vitality . . 
0 ||| after sitting through this sloppy , made-for-movie comedy special , it makes me wonder if lawrence hates criticism so much that he refuses to evaluate his own work . 
1 ||| it's obviously struck a responsive chord with many south koreans , and should work its magic in other parts of the world . 
1 ||| while [roman coppola] scores points for style , he staggers in terms of story . 
1 ||| thankfully , the film , which skirts that rapidly deteriorating line between fantasy and reality . . . takes a tongue-in-cheek attitude even as it pushes the croc hunter agenda . 
0 ||| too smart to ignore but a little too smugly superior to like , this could be a movie that ends up slapping its target audience in the face by shooting itself in the foot . 
0 ||| don't be fooled by the impressive cast list - eye see you is pure junk . 
1 ||| this is mostly well-constructed fluff , which is all it seems intended to be . 
0 ||| all's well that ends well , and rest assured , the consciousness-raising lessons are cloaked in gross-out gags . 
1 |||  . . . if you're in a mind set for goofy comedy , the troopers will entertain with their gross outs , bawdy comedy and head games . 
1 ||| lovingly photographed in the manner of a golden book sprung to life , stuart little 2 manages sweetness largely without stickiness . 
1 ||| passion , melodrama , sorrow , laugther , and tears cascade over the screen effortlessly . . . 
0 ||| although huppert's intensity and focus has a raw exhilaration about it , the piano teacher is anything but fun . 
1 ||| the story that emerges has elements of romance , tragedy and even silent-movie comedy . 
0 ||| here's a case of two actors who do everything humanly possible to create characters who are sweet and believable , and are defeated by a screenplay that forces them into bizarre , implausible behavior . 
0 ||| what remains is a variant of the nincompoop benigni persona , here a more annoying , though less angry version of the irresponsible sandlerian manchild , undercut by the voice of the star of road trip . 
0 ||| the waterlogged script plumbs uncharted depths of stupidity , incoherence and sub-sophomoric sexual banter . 
1 ||| a budget affair that exposes the generally sad existence of the bedouins while providing a precious twinkle of insight into their lives . 
1 ||| it's a film that's destined to win a wide summer audience through word-of-mouth reviews and , not far down the line , to find a place among the studio's animated classics . 
0 ||| no aspirations to social import inform the movie version . this is a shameless sham , calculated to cash in on the popularity of its stars . 
1 ||| day is not a great bond movie , but it is a good bond movie , which still makes it much better than your typical bond knock-offs . 
1 ||| the movie's eventual success should be credited to dennis quaid , in fighting trim shape as an athlete as well as an actor
0 ||| they were afraid to show this movie to reviewers before its opening , afraid of the bad reviews they thought they'd earn . they were right . 
1 ||| a painfully funny ode to bad behavior . 
1 ||| the film's heady yet far from impenetrable theory suggests that russians take comfort in their closed-off nationalist reality . 
1 ||| the plot twists give i am trying to break your heart an attraction it desperately needed . 
0 ||| murder by numbers is like a couple of mediocre tv-movie -of-the-week films clumsily stuck together . 
1 ||| a film centering on a traditional indian wedding in contemporary new delhi may not sound like specialized fare , but mira nair's film is an absolute delight for all audiences . 
0 ||| expect the same-old , lame-old slasher nonsense , just with different scenery . 
1 ||| despite a story predictable enough to make the sound of music play like a nail-biting thriller , its heart is so much in the right place it is difficult to get really peeved at it . 
1 |||  " home movie " is the film equivalent of a lovingly rendered coffee table book . 
1 ||| a fast , funny , highly enjoyable movie . 
0 ||| scorsese at his best makes gangster films that are equally lovely but also relentlessly brutal and brutally intelligent ; perdition , meanwhile , reads more like driving miss daisy than goodfellas . 
1 ||| the film becomes an overwhelming pleasure , and you find yourself rooting for gai's character to avoid the fate that has befallen every other carmen before her . 
0 ||| [t]he script isn't up to the level of the direction , nor are the uneven performances by the cast members , who seem bound and determined to duplicate bela lugosi's now-cliched vampire accent . 
0 ||| i am sorry that i was unable to get the full brunt of the comedy . 
0 ||| goes on and on to the point of nausea . 
1 ||| uplifting , funny and wise . 
0 ||| two big things are missing -- anything approaching a visceral kick , and anything approaching even a vague reason to sit through it all . 
1 ||| a culture-clash comedy that , in addition to being very funny , captures some of the discomfort and embarrassment of being a bumbling american in europe . 
0 ||| intriguing documentary which is emotionally diluted by focusing on the story's least interesting subject . 
0 ||| the direction , by george hickenlooper , has no snap to it , no wiseacre crackle or hard-bitten cynicism . 
0 ||| these people wouldn't know subtle characterization if it put on a giant furry monster costume and then gave them a lapdance . 
1 ||| two hours fly by -- opera's a pleasure when you don't have to endure intermissions -- and even a novice to the form comes away exhilarated . 
1 ||| harks back to a time when movies had more to do with imagination than market research . 
1 ||| executed with such gentle but insistent sincerity , with such good humor and appreciation of the daily grind that only the most hardhearted scrooge could fail to respond . 
1 ||| the best revenge may just be living well because this film , unlike other dumas adaptations , is far more likened to a treasure than a lengthy jail sentence . 
0 ||| storytelling feels slight . 
1 ||| audrey tatou has a knack for picking roles that magnify her outrageous charm , and in this literate french comedy , she's as morning-glory exuberant as she was in am�lie . 
0 ||| the most excruciating 86 minutes one might sit through this summer that do not involve a dentist drill . 
0 ||| ' . . . the cast portrays their cartoon counterparts well . . . but quite frankly , scoob and shag don't eat enough during the film . '
1 |||  . . . a guiltless film for nice evening out . 
0 ||| cacoyannis is perhaps too effective in creating an atmosphere of dust-caked stagnation and labored gentility . 
1 ||| manages to accomplish what few sequels can -- it equals the original and in some ways even betters it . 
1 ||| it's not life-affirming � its vulgar and mean , but i liked it . 
1 |||  . . . a powerful sequel and one of the best films of the year . 
1 ||| you have enough finely tuned acting to compensate for the movie's failings . 
0 ||| how can such a cold movie claim to express warmth and longing ? in truth , it has all the heart of a porno flick ( but none of the sheer lust ) . 
1 ||| seems based on ugly ideas instead of ugly behavior , as happiness was . . . hence , storytelling is far more appealing . 
1 ||| a beautifully tooled action thriller about love and terrorism in korea . 
0 ||| some of their jokes work , but most fail miserably and in the end , pumpkin is far more offensive than it is funny . 
0 ||| stealing harvard will dip into your wallet , swipe 90 minutes of your time , and offer you precisely this in recompense : a few early laughs scattered around a plot as thin as it is repetitious . 
1 ||| star wars is back in a major way . 
1 ||| this english-language version . . . does full honor to miyazaki's teeming and often unsettling landscape , and to the conflicted complexity of his characters . 
1 ||| it's . . . worth the extra effort to see an artist , still committed to growth in his ninth decade , change while remaining true to his principles with a film whose very subject is , quite pointedly , about the peril of such efforts . 
1 ||| can be viewed as pure composition and form -- film as music
0 ||| this film biggest problem ? no laughs . 
0 ||| a rather average action film that benefits from several funny moments supplied by epps . 
1 ||| both a beautifully made nature film and a tribute to a woman whose passion for this region and its inhabitants still shines in her quiet blue eyes . 
0 ||| passion , lip-synching , tragedy , and lots of really really high notes . for me , this opera isn't a favorite , so it's a long time before the fat lady sings . 
1 ||| a refreshing change from the usual whoopee-cushion effort aimed at the youth market . 
0 ||| mendes still doesn't quite know how to fill a frame . like the hanks character , he's a slow study : the action is stilted and the tabloid energy embalmed . 
0 |||  " collateral damage " goes by the numbers and reps decent action entertainment until the silly showdown ending that forces the viewer to totally suspend disbelief
0 ||| the question hanging over the time machine is not , as the main character suggests , 'what if ? ' but rather , 'how can you charge money for this ? '
0 ||| this overproduced piece of dreck is shockingly bad and absolutely unnecessary . hmmm�might i suggest that the wayward wooden one end it all by stuffing himself into an electric pencil sharpener ? 
1 ||| no wonder they're talking about " talk to her . " it's astonishing . 
1 ||| tender yet lacerating and darkly funny fable . 
1 ||| i found the ring moderately absorbing , largely for its elegantly colorful look and sound . 
1 ||| that dogged good will of the parents and 'vain' jia's defoliation of ego , make the film touching despite some doldrums . 
1 ||| a cop story that understands the medium amazingly well . 
0 ||| there's some good material in their story about a retail clerk wanting more out of life , but the movie too often spins its wheels with familiar situations and repetitive scenes . 
0 |||  . . . what a banal bore the preachy circuit turns out to be
0 ||| too simple for its own good . 
0 ||| another boorish movie from the i-heard-a-joke- at-a-frat-party school of screenwriting . 
1 ||| for most of its footage , the new thriller proves that director m . night shyamalan can weave an eerie spell and that mel gibson can gasp , shudder and even tremble without losing his machismo . 
0 ||| there is only so much baked cardboard i need to chew . 
1 ||| a thriller made from a completist's checklist rather than with a cultist's passion . 
0 ||| coupling disgracefully written dialogue with flailing bodily movements that substitute for acting , circuit is the awkwardly paced soap opera-ish story . 
0 ||| a family-friendly fantasy that ends up doing very little with its imaginative premise . 
1 ||| a stunning and overwhelmingly cogent case for kissinger as a calculating war criminal . 
0 ||| the narrative is so consistently unimaginative that probably the only way to have saved the film is with the aid of those wisecracking mystery science theater 3000 guys . 
1 ||| be patient with the lovely hush ! and your reward will be a thoughtful , emotional movie experience . 
1 ||| an engrossing portrait of uncompromising artists trying to create something original against the backdrop of a corporate music industry that only seems to care about the bottom line . 
0 ||| with more character development this might have been an eerie thriller ; with better payoffs , it could have been a thinking man's monster movie . 
1 ||| together , tok and o orchestrate a buoyant , darkly funny dance of death . in the process , they demonstrate that there's still a lot of life in hong kong cinema . 
1 ||| it's hard to imagine anybody ever being " in the mood " to view a movie as harrowing and painful as the grey zone , but it's equally hard to imagine anybody being able to tear their eyes away from the screen once it's started . 
0 ||| it is most of the things costner movies are known for ; it's sanctimonious , self-righteous and so eager to earn our love that you want to slap it . 
1 ||| the far future may be awesome to consider , but from period detail to matters of the heart , this film is most transporting when it stays put in the past . 
1 ||| though a capable thriller , somewhere along the way k-19 jettisoned some crucial drama . 
1 ||| a dream cast of solid female talent who build a seamless ensemble . there isn't a weak or careless performance amongst them . 
0 ||| dull , lifeless , and amateurishly assembled . 
1 ||| an enthralling aesthetic experience , one that's steeped in mystery and a ravishing , baroque beauty . 
0 ||| what's missing in murder by numbers is any real psychological grounding for the teens' deviant behaviour . being latently gay and liking to read are hardly enough . 
1 ||| boisterous and daft documentary . 
1 ||| there are moments it can be heart-rending in an honest and unaffected ( and gentle ) way . 
0 ||| to build a feel-good fantasy around a vain dictator-madman is off-putting , to say the least , not to mention inappropriate and wildly undeserved . 
0 ||| though howard demonstrates a great eye as a director , this southern gothic drama is sadly a tough sit , with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy-handed metaphors to choke a horse -- or at least slow him down to a canter . 
0 |||  . . . unlikable , uninteresting , unfunny , and completely , utterly inept . 
1 ||| a terrific b movie -- in fact , the best in recent memory . 
0 ||| less funny than it should be and less funny than it thinks it is . 
0 ||| [janey] forgets about her other obligations , leading to a tragedy which is somehow guessable from the first few minutes , maybe because it echoes the by now intolerable morbidity of so many recent movies . 
0 ||| what is 100% missing here is a script of even the most elemental literacy , an inkling of genuine wit , and anything resembling acting . 
0 ||| a crude teen-oriented variation on a theme that the playwright craig lucas explored with infinitely more grace and eloquence in his prelude to a kiss . 
1 |||  . . . wallace is smart to vary the pitch of his movie , balancing deafening battle scenes with quieter domestic scenes of women back home receiving war department telegrams . 
0 ||| despite the pyrotechnics , narc is strictly by the book . 
1 ||| what's most memorable about circuit is that it's shot on digital video , whose tiny camera enables shafer to navigate spaces both large . . . and small . . . with considerable aplomb . 
0 ||| a close-to-solid espionage thriller with the misfortune of being released a few decades too late . 
1 ||| a sensitive and astute first feature by anne-sophie birot . 
0 ||| an allegory concerning the chronically mixed signals african american professionals get about overachieving could be intriguing , but the supernatural trappings only obscure the message . 
0 ||| a film that loses sight of its own story . 
0 ||| there are cheesy backdrops , ridiculous action sequences , and many tired jokes about men in heels . 
1 ||| the salton sea has moments of inspired humour , though every scrap is of the darkest variety . 
1 ||| a thriller with an edge -- which is to say that it doesn't follow the stale , standard , connect-the-dots storyline which has become commonplace in movies that explore the seamy underbelly of the criminal world . 
1 ||| parts of the film feel a bit too much like an infomercial for ram dass's latest book aimed at the boomer demographic . but mostly it's a work that , with humor , warmth , and intelligence , captures a life interestingly lived . 
1 ||| a different movie -- sometimes tedious -- by a director many viewers would like to skip but film buffs should get to know . 
1 ||| the faithful will enjoy this sometimes wry adaptation of v . s . naipaul's novel , but newcomers may find themselves stifling a yawn or two during the first hour . 
0 |||  " i blame all men for war , " [the warden's daughter] tells her father . the movie is about as deep as that sentiment . 
1 ||| smart , sassy interpretation of the oscar wilde play . 
0 ||| chai's structure and pacing are disconcertingly slack . 
1 ||| it's quaid who anchors the film with his effortless performance and that trademark grin of his -- so perfect for a ballplayer . 
0 ||| if this disposable tissue has one wild card , it's john turturro , who's simply fab as a spanish butler with a foot fetish . 
1 ||| if we sometimes need comforting fantasies about mental illness , we also need movies like tim mccann's revolution no . 9 . 
1 ||| grant carries the day with impeccable comic timing , raffish charm and piercing intellect . 
1 ||| many went to see the attraction for the sole reason that it was hot outside and there was air conditioning inside , and i don't think that a . c . will help this movie one bit . 
0 ||| it aimlessly and unsuccessfully attempts to fuse at least three dull plots into one good one . 
1 ||| a hypnotic portrait of this sad , compulsive life . 
1 ||| the long-range appeal of " minority report " should transcend any awards it bags . this is one for the ages . 
1 ||| skip work to see it at the first opportunity . 
1 ||| a highly intriguing thriller , coupled with some ingenious plot devices and some lavishly built settings . . it's a worthwhile tutorial in quantum physics and slash-dash
1 ||| a complex psychological drama about a father who returns to his son's home after decades away . 
0 ||| it almost plays like solaris , but with guns and jokes . 
0 ||| it's so tedious that it makes you forgive every fake , dishonest , entertaining and , ultimately , more perceptive moment in bridget jones's diary . 
0 |||  . . . feels as if ( there's ) a choke leash around your neck so director nick cassavetes can give it a good , hard yank whenever he wants you to feel something . 
0 ||| less worrying about covering all the drama in frida's life and more time spent exploring her process of turning pain into art would have made this a superior movie . 
1 ||| like most bond outings in recent years , some of the stunts are so outlandish that they border on being cartoonlike . a heavy reliance on cgi technology is beginning to creep into the series . 
0 ||| a cheerful enough but imminently forgettable rip-off of [besson's] earlier work . 
0 ||| this film is too busy hitting all of its assigned marks to take on any life of its own . 
0 ||| uneasy mishmash of styles and genres . 
0 ||| sucking all the 'classic' out of robert louis stevenson's treasure island and filling the void with sci-fi video game graphics and disney-fied adolescent angst . . . 
1 ||| bleakly funny , its characters all the more touching for refusing to pity or memorialize themselves . 
1 ||| wonder of wonders -- a teen movie with a humanistic message . 
0 ||| woody allen used to ridicule movies like hollywood ending . now he makes them . 
1 ||| still pretentious and filled with subtext , but entertaining enough at 'face value' to recommend to anyone looking for something different . 
1 ||| well-acted , well-directed and , for all its moodiness , not too pretentious . 
1 ||| it's fun , wispy , wise and surprisingly inoffensive for a film about a teen in love with his stepmom . 
0 ||| we never truly come to care about the main characters and whether or not they'll wind up together , and michele's spiritual quest is neither amusing nor dramatic enough to sustain interest . 
0 ||| all the small moments and flashbacks don't add up to much more than trite observations on the human condition . 
1 ||| morton deserves an oscar nomination . 
1 ||| australian filmmaker david flatman uses the huge-screen format to make an old-fashioned nature film that educates viewers with words and pictures while entertaining them . 
0 ||| a generic family comedy unlikely to be appreciated by anyone outside the under-10 set . 
0 ||| it's always disappointing when a documentary fails to live up to -- or offer any new insight into -- its chosen topic . unfortunately , that's precisely what arthur dong's family fundamentals does . 
1 ||| the color sense of stuart little 2 is its most immediate and most obvious pleasure , but it would count for very little if the movie weren't as beautifully shaped and as delicately calibrated in tone as it is . 
0 ||| excessive , profane , packed with cartoonish violence and comic-strip characters . 
1 ||| see it . debate it . remember it . 
1 ||| the ending feels at odds with the rest of the film . 
0 ||| barry sonnenfeld owes frank the pug big time
0 ||| the pace and the visuals are so hyped up that a curious sense of menace informs everything . 
1 ||| the bai brothers have taken an small slice of history and opened it up for all of us to understand , and they've told a nice little story in the process . 
1 ||| uneven but a lot of fun . 
0 ||| jackson shamefully strolls through this mess with a smug grin , inexplicably wearing a kilt and carrying a bag of golf clubs over one shoulder . 
0 ||| supposedly based upon real , or at least soberly reported incidents , the film ends with a large human tragedy . alas , getting there is not even half the interest . 
0 ||| julie davis is the kathie lee gifford of film directors , sadly proving once again ego doesn't always go hand in hand with talent . 
0 ||| the most surprising thing about this film is that they are actually releasing it into theaters . 
1 ||| mostly works because of the universal themes , earnest performances . . . and excellent use of music by india's popular gulzar and jagjit singh . 
0 ||| let's face it -- there aren't many reasons anyone would want to see crossroads if they're not big fans of teen pop kitten britney spears . 
0 ||| a waste of fearless purity in the acting craft . 
1 ||| it's hard to imagine anyone managing to steal a movie not only from charismatic rising star jake gyllenhaal but also from accomplished oscar winners susan sarandon , dustin hoffman and holly hunter , yet newcomer ellen pompeo pulls off the feat with aplomb . 
0 ||| lurid and less than lucid work . 
0 ||| a loquacious and dreary piece of business . 
1 ||| if a big musical number like 'praise the lord , he's the god of second chances' doesn't put you off , this will be an enjoyable choice for younger kids . 
0 ||| it goes on for too long and bogs down in a surfeit of characters and unnecessary subplots . 
1 ||| in the pianist , polanski is saying what he has long wanted to say , confronting the roots of his own preoccupations and obsessions , and he allows nothing to get in the way . 
0 ||| i can easily imagine benigni's pinocchio becoming a christmas perennial . coal isn't as easy to come by as it used to be and this would be a worthy substitute for naughty children's stockings . 
1 ||| a great cast and a wonderful but sometimes confusing flashback movie about growing up in a dysfunctional family . 
0 ||| being unique doesn't necessarily equate to being good , no matter how admirably the filmmakers have gone for broke . 
1 ||| the warm presence of zhao benshan makes the preposterous lying hero into something more than he reasonably should be . 
1 ||| even if invincible is not quite the career peak that the pianist is for roman polanski , it demonstrates that werner herzog can still leave us with a sense of wonder at the diverse , marvelously twisted shapes history has taken . 
1 ||| a blessed gift to film geeks and historians . if the '70's were your idea of a good time at the movies , this will make you very happy . 
1 ||| fuller would surely have called this gutsy and at times exhilarating movie a great yarn . 
0 ||| if myers decides to make another austin powers movie , maybe he should just stick with austin and dr evil . 
1 ||| fulford-wierzbicki . . . deftly captures the wise-beyond-her-years teen . 
0 ||| this charmless nonsense ensues amid clanging film references that make jay and silent bob's excellent adventure seem understated . 
1 ||| this is a movie that refreshes the mind and spirit along with the body , so original is its content , look , and style . 
1 ||| a moving and important film . 
1 ||| although german cooking does not come readily to mind when considering the world's best cuisine , mostly martha could make deutchland a popular destination for hungry tourists . 
1 ||| [d]oesn't bother being as cloying or preachy as equivalent evangelical christian movies -- maybe the filmmakers know that the likely audience will already be among the faithful . 
0 ||| despite a blue-chip cast and a provocative title , writer-director peter mattei's first feature microwaves dull leftover romantic motifs basted in faux-contemporary gravy . 
1 ||| roman polanski's autobiographical gesture at redemption is better than 'shindler's list' - it is more than merely a holocaust movie . 
1 ||| a lively and engaging examination of how similar obsessions can dominate a family . 
0 ||| meanders between its powerful moments . 
0 ||| aaliyah rarely dampens her diva persona enough to spark genuine chemistry with townsend . when she speaks , her creepy egyptian demigod voice is as computer processed and overproduced as it was in her music . 
0 ||| instead of making his own style , director marcus adams just copies from various sources � good sources , bad mixture
0 ||| the element of surprise might be the only thing femme fatale has going for it . 
1 ||| a dazzling thing to behold -- as long as you're wearing the somewhat cumbersome 3d goggles the theater provides . 
0 ||| if ever a concept came handed down from the movie gods on a silver platter , this is it . if ever such a dependable concept was botched in execution , this is it . 
0 ||| chen films the resolutely downbeat smokers only with every indulgent , indie trick in the book . 
0 ||| even those of a single digit age will be able to recognize that this story is too goofy . . . even for disney . 
1 ||| directors brett morgen and nanette burstein have put together a bold biographical fantasia . 
0 ||| despite its promising cast of characters , big trouble remains a loosely tied series of vignettes which only prove that 'zany' doesn't necessarily mean 'funny . '
1 ||| if you're down for a silly hack-and-slash flick , you can do no wrong with jason x . 
0 ||| predictable and cloying , though brown sugar is so earnest in its yearning for the days before rap went nihilistic that it summons more spirit and bite than your average formulaic romantic quadrangle . 
1 ||| it has the charm of the original american road movies , feasting on the gorgeous , ramshackle landscape of the filmmaker's motherland . 
1 ||| nicely serves as an examination of a society in transition . 
1 ||| mais um momento inspirado de david fincher . 
0 ||| if you're not fans of the adventues of steve and terri , you should avoid this like the dreaded king brown snake . personally , i'd rather watch them on the animal planet . 
0 ||| the script isn't very good ; not even someone as gifted as hoffman ( the actor ) can make it work . 
0 ||| while there's likely very little crossover appeal to those without much interest in the elizabethans ( as well as rank frustration from those in the know about rubbo's dumbed-down tactics ) , much ado about something is an amicable endeavor . 
0 ||| bluto blutarsky , we miss you . 
0 ||| a static and sugary little half-hour , after-school special about interfaith understanding , stretched out to 90 minutes . 
0 ||| a wannabe comedy of manners about a brainy prep-school kid with a mrs . robinson complex founders on its own preciousness -- and squanders its beautiful women . 
1 ||| it has a subtle way of getting under your skin and sticking with you long after it's over . 
1 ||| the wonderful combination of the sweetness and the extraordinary technical accomplishments of the first film are maintained , but its overall impact falls a little flat with a storyline that never quite delivers the original magic . 
0 ||| children and adults enamored of all things pokemon won't be disappointed . 
0 ||| the movie turns out to be [assayas'] homage to the gallic 'tradition of quality , ' in all its fusty squareness . 
0 ||| proves that a movie about goodness is not the same thing as a good movie . 
0 ||| the acting is amateurish , the cinematography is atrocious , the direction is clumsy , the writing is insipid and the violence is at once luridly graphic and laughably unconvincing . 
1 ||| the movie has an infectious exuberance that will engage anyone with a passing interest in the skate/surf culture , the l . a . beach scene and the imaginative ( and sometimes illegal ) ways kids can make a playground out of the refuse of adults . 
0 ||| watching austin powers in goldmember is like binging on cotton candy . it's sweet and fluffy at the time , but it may leave you feeling a little sticky and unsatisfied . 
0 ||| a movie far more cynical and lazy than anything a fictitious charlie kaufman might object to . 
1 ||| unfolds in a low-key , organic way that encourages you to accept it as life and go with its flow . 
0 ||| it's just disappointingly superficial -- a movie that has all the elements necessary to be a fascinating , involving character study , but never does more than scratch the surface . 
0 ||| what more can be expected from a college comedy that's target audience hasn't graduated from junior high school ? 
1 ||| it's a humble effort , but spiced with wry humor and genuine pathos , especially between morgan and redgrave . 
0 ||| jacobi , the most fluent of actors , is given relatively dry material from nijinsky's writings to perform , and the visuals , even erotically frank ones , become dullingly repetitive . 
1 |||  . . . " bowling for columbine " remains a disquieting and thought-provoking film . . . 
1 ||| we do get the distinct impression that this franchise is drawing to a close . 
0 ||| there's a scientific law to be discerned here that producers would be well to heed : mediocre movies start to drag as soon as the action speeds up ; when the explosions start , they fall to pieces . 
0 ||| less a study in madness or love than a study in schoolgirl obsession . 
1 ||| this version incarnates the prophetic book in a way even its exacting author might admire . 
0 ||| the film is so bad it doesn't improve upon the experience of staring at a blank screen . 
0 ||| routine and rather silly . 
0 ||| while we want macdowell's character to retrieve her husband , we have to ask whether her personal odyssey trumps the carnage that claims so many lives around her . 
0 ||| in the spirit of the season , i assign one bright shining star to roberto benigni's pinocchio -- but i guarantee that no wise men will be following after it . 
0 |||  . . . turns so unforgivably trite in its last 10 minutes that anyone without a fortified sweet tooth will likely go into sugar shock . 
0 ||| at least it's a fairly impressive debut from the director , charles stone iii . 
0 ||| an uninspired preachy and clich�d war film . 
0 ||| imagine a really bad community theater production of west side story without the songs . 
0 ||| control-alt-delete simone as quickly as possible
1 ||| maryam is more timely now than ever . 
1 ||| a slick , engrossing melodrama . 
0 ||| every so often a film comes along that is so insanely stupid , so awful in so many ways that watching it leaves you giddy . half past dead is just such an achievement . 
1 ||| this documentary is a dazzling , remarkably unpretentious reminder of what [evans] had , lost , and got back . 
0 ||| well-meaning but inert . 
0 ||| it's rare to see a movie that takes such a speedy swan dive from " promising " to " interesting " to " familiar " before landing squarely on " stupid " . 
0 ||| tartakovsky's team has some freakish powers of visual charm , but the five writers slip into the modern rut of narrative banality . 
1 ||| a glorious mess . 
0 ||| yes , i suppose it's lovely that cal works out his issues with his dad and comes to terms with his picture-perfect life -- but world traveler gave me no reason to care , so i didn't . 
0 ||| the film's darker moments become smoothed over by an overwhelming need to tender inspirational tidings , especially in the last few cloying moments . 
0 ||| unlike his directorial efforts , la femme nikita and the professional , the transporter lacks besson's perspective as a storyteller . 
1 ||| [it's] a clever thriller with enough unexpected twists to keep our interest . 
0 ||| so verbally flatfooted and so emotionally predictable or bland that it plays like the standard made-for-tv movie . 
0 ||| directors john musker and ron clements , the team behind the little mermaid , have produced sparkling retina candy , but they aren't able to muster a lot of emotional resonance in the cold vacuum of space . 
0 |||  . . . the film falls back on the same old formula of teen sex , outrageous pranks and scenes designed to push the envelope of bad taste for laughs . 
1 |||  a thought-provoking look at how western foreign policy - however well intentioned - can wreak havoc in other cultures . 
1 ||| an extremely funny , ultimately heartbreaking look at life in contemporary china . 
0 ||| predictably melodramatic . 
0 ||| the sinister inspiration that fuelled devito's early work is confused in death to smoochy into something both ugly and mindless . 
1 ||| disappointingly , the characters are too strange and dysfunctional , tom included , to ever get under the skin , but this is compensated in large part by the off-the-wall dialogue , visual playfulness and the outlandishness of the idea itself . 
0 ||| it's also clear from the start that the transporter is running purely on adrenaline , and once the initial high wears off , the film's shortcomings start to shine through . 
1 ||| you wouldn't call the good girl a date movie ( an anti-date movie is more like it ) , but when it's good , it's good and horrid . 
1 ||| constantly touching , surprisingly funny , semi-surrealist exploration of the creative act . 
1 ||| the humor and humanity of monsoon wedding are in perfect balance . 
0 ||| muddled , trashy and incompetent
1 ||| admirers of director abel ferrara may be relieved that his latest feature , r xmas , marks a modest if encouraging return to form . 
0 ||| if melville is creatively a great whale , this film is canned tuna . 
0 ||| the film is all over the place , really . it dabbles all around , never gaining much momentum . 
1 ||| it is the sheer , selfish , wound-licking , bar-scrapping doggedness of leon's struggle to face and transmute his demons that makes the movie a spirited and touching occasion , despite its patchy construction . 
1 ||| i was impressed by how many tit-for-tat retaliatory responses the filmmakers allow before pulling the plug on the conspirators and averting an american-russian armageddon . 
0 ||| drives for the same kind of bittersweet , conciliatory tone that three seasons achieved but loses its way in rhetorical excess and blatant sentimentality . 
1 ||| enormously likable , partly because it is aware of its own grasp of the absurd . 
0 ||| femme fatale offers nothing more than a bait-and-switch that is beyond playing fair with the audience . are we dealing with dreams , visions or being told what actually happened as if it were the third ending of clue ? 
1 |||  . . . mesmerizing , an eye-opening tour of modern beijing culture in a journey of rebellion , retreat into oblivion and return . 
1 ||| an often watchable , though goofy and lurid , blast of a costume drama set in the late 15th century . 
1 ||| [allen] manages to breathe life into this somewhat tired premise . 
1 ||| not quite as miraculous as its dreamworks makers would have you believe , but it more than adequately fills the eyes and stirs the emotions . 
0 ||| there's no disguising this as one of the worst films of the summer . or for the year , for that matter . 
1 ||| dolgin and franco fashion a fascinating portrait of a vietnamese-born youngster who eagerly and easily assimilated as an all-american girl with a brand new name in southern tennessee . 
1 ||| see scratch for the history , see scratch for the music , see scratch for a lesson in scratching , but , most of all , see it for the passion . 
0 ||| lacks dramatic punch and depth . 
1 ||| as the two leads , lathan and diggs are charming and have chemistry both as friends and lovers . 
0 ||| looks more like a travel-agency video targeted at people who like to ride bikes topless and roll in the mud than a worthwhile glimpse of independent-community guiding lights . 
1 |||  " the best disney movie since the lion king " 
0 ||| your taste for jonah - a veggie tales movie may well depend on your threshold for pop manifestations of the holy spirit . 
1 ||| call this the full monty on ice , the underdog sports team formula redux . 
1 ||| like old myths and wonder tales spun afresh . 
1 ||| this clever caper movie has twists worthy of david mamet and is enormous fun for thinking audiences . 
0 ||| woody , what happened ? 
0 ||| collapses under its own meager weight . 
0 ||| one of the worst movies of the year . . . . watching it was painful . 
0 ||| these guys seem great to knock back a beer with but they're simply not funny performers . 
1 ||| a classic fairy tale that perfectly captures the wonders and worries of childhood in a way that few movies have ever approached . 
0 ||| wait for it to hit cable . 
0 ||| manipulative claptrap , a period-piece movie-of-the-week , plain old blarney . . . take your pick . all three descriptions suit evelyn , a besotted and obvious drama that tells us nothing new . 
1 ||| may be the most undeserving victim of critical overkill since town and country . 
0 ||| this is a truly , truly bad movie . 
1 ||| it won't bust your gut -- and it's not intended to -- it's merely a blandly cinematic surgical examination of what makes a joke a joke . 
0 ||| don't let the subtitles fool you ; the movie only proves that hollywood no longer has a monopoly on mindless action . 
0 ||| a series of escapades demonstrating the adage that what is good for the goose is also good for the gander , some of which occasionally amuses but none of which amounts to much of a story . 
0 ||| the whole film has this sneaky feel to it as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as very important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a hollywood product . 
0 ||| silly , loud and goofy . 
1 ||| with an expressive face reminiscent of gong li and a vivid personality like zhang ziyi's , dong stakes out the emotional heart of happy . 
0 ||| deliberately and devotedly constructed , far from heaven is too picture postcard perfect , too neat and new pin-like , too obviously a recreation to resonate . 
1 ||| if you're looking for something new and hoping for something entertaining , you're in luck . 
0 ||| what's next ? the porky's revenge : ultimate edition ? 
1 ||| if you can get past the fantastical aspects and harsh realities of " the isle " you'll get a sock-you-in-the-eye flick that is a visual tour-de-force and a story that is unlike any you will likely see anywhere else . 
0 ||| thoroughly awful . 
1 ||| this is a story that zings all the way through with originality , humour and pathos . 
1 ||| a gentle , compassionate drama about grief and healing . 
0 ||| what the director can&#8217 ; t do is make either of val kilmer&#8217 ; s two personas interesting or worth caring about . 
0 ||| kicks off with an inauspicious premise , mopes through a dreary tract of virtually plotless meanderings and then ends with a whimper . 
1 ||| hoffman notches in the nuances of pain , but his smart , edgy voice and waddling profile ( emphasized here ) accent the humor of wilson's plight , and that saves his pathos from drippiness . 
0 ||| a lackluster , unessential sequel to the classic disney adaptation of j . m . barrie's peter pan . 
1 ||| a movie that will thrill you , touch you and make you laugh as well . 
0 ||| each story is built on a potentially interesting idea , but the first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting , while the third feels limited by its short running time . 
1 ||| a rock-solid gangster movie with a fair amount of suspense , intriguing characters and bizarre bank robberies , plus a heavy dose of father-and-son dynamics . 
1 ||| a coming-of-age movie that hollywood wouldn't have the guts to make . 
0 ||| if you really want to understand what this story is really all about , you're far better served by the source material . 
0 ||| the mystery of enigma is how a rich historical subject , combined with so much first-rate talent . . . could have yielded such a flat , plodding picture . 
1 ||| this breezy caper movie becomes a soulful , incisive meditation on the way we were , and the way we are . 
0 ||| nearly all the fundamentals you take for granted in most films are mishandled here . 
0 ||| enchanted with low-life tragedy and liberally seasoned with emotional outbursts . . . what is sorely missing , however , is the edge of wild , lunatic invention that we associate with cage's best acting . 
1 ||| a resonant tale of racism , revenge and retribution . 
1 ||| a smart and funny , albeit sometimes superficial , cautionary tale of a technology in search of an artist . 
0 ||| first-time director jo�o pedro rodrigues' unwillingness to define his hero's background or motivations becomes more and more frustrating as the film goes on . 
1 ||| a compelling allegory about the last days of germany's democratic weimar republic . 
1 ||| that 'alabama' manages to be pleasant in spite of its predictability and occasional slowness is due primarily to the perkiness of witherspoon ( who is always a joy to watch , even when her material is not first-rate ) . . . 
1 ||| an uncomfortable experience , but one as brave and challenging as you could possibly expect these days from american cinema . 
0 ||| in this film we at least see a study in contrasts ; the wide range of one actor , and the limited range of a comedian . 
0 ||| the sequel has turned completely and irrevocably bizarre to the point of utter nonsense . 
0 |||  . . . perhaps the heaviest , most joyless movie ever made about giant dragons taking over the world . 
1 ||| an entertaining mix of period drama and flat-out farce that should please history fans . 
1 ||| like a poor man's you can count on me
0 ||| exploitative and largely devoid of the depth or sophistication that would make watching such a graphic treatment of the crimes bearable . 
1 ||| this is pure , exciting moviemaking . you won't exactly know what's happening but you'll be blissfully exhausted . 
1 |||  . . . enthusiastically invokes the percussion rhythm , the brass soul and the sense of fierce competition that helps make great marching bands half the fun of college football games . 
1 ||| chicago offers much colorful eye candy , including the spectacle of gere in his dancing shoes , hoofing and crooning with the best of them . 
1 ||| broomfield is energized by volletta wallace's maternal fury , her fearlessness , and because of that , his film crackles . 
0 ||| this is mild-mannered , been-there material given a pedestrian spin by a director who needed a touch of the flamboyant , the outrageous . 
1 ||| piccoli gives a superb performance full of deep feeling . 
0 ||| [johnnie to and wai ka fai are] sure to find an enthusiastic audience among american action-adventure buffs , but the film's interests may be too narrow to attract crossover viewers . 
1 ||| the film is an earnest try at beachcombing verismo , but it would be even more indistinct than it is were it not for the striking , quietly vulnerable personality of ms . ambrose . 
1 ||| k-19 : the widowmaker is a great yarn . 
1 ||| 4 friends , 2 couples , 2000 miles , and all the pabst blue ribbon beer they can drink - it's the ultimate redneck road-trip . 
0 ||| glib , satirical documentary that fudges facts , makes facile points and engages in the cinematic equivalent of tabloid journalism . 
1 ||| 'pocas veces es posible ver un elenco tan compenetrado con la historia , donde todos y cada uno de los actores ofrecen actuaciones verdaderamente memorables . '
1 ||| as the princess , sorvino glides gracefully from male persona to female without missing a beat . ben kingsley is truly funny , playing a kind of ghandi gone bad . 
0 ||| city by the sea is a gritty police thriller with all the dysfunctional family dynamics one could wish for . but how it washed out despite all of that is the project's prime mystery . 
0 ||| disjointed parody . 
0 ||| been there , done that . . . a thousand times already , and better . 
0 ||| an uplifting drama . . . what antwone fisher isn't , however , is original . 
1 ||| while insomnia is in many ways a conventional , even predictable remake , nolan's penetrating undercurrent of cerebral and cinemantic flair lends ( it ) stimulating depth . 
0 ||| the film is ultimately about as inspiring as a hallmark card . 
1 ||| the biggest problem with this movie is that it's not nearly long enough . 
1 ||| it's great escapist fun that recreates a place and time that will never happen again . 
1 ||| it's always fascinating to watch marker the essayist at work . 
1 ||| i can't say that i liked homeboy ; it'd be more accurate to say that i found it intriguing , bizarre , dogma-like in spots - and quite truthful , in its way . 
0 ||| everything is off . 
0 ||| an affable but undernourished romantic comedy that fails to match the freshness of the actress-producer and writer's previous collaboration , miss congeniality . 
1 ||| a movie that will wear you out and make you misty even when you don't want to be . 
1 ||| what makes the movie special is its utter sincerity . 
1 ||| genuinely touching because it's realistic about all kinds of love . 
1 ||| at its best . . . festival in cannes bubbles with the excitement of the festival in cannes . 
0 ||| we started to wonder if some unpaid intern had just typed 'chris rock , ' 'anthony hopkins' and 'terrorists' into some univac-like script machine . 
1 ||| rain is a small treasure , enveloping the viewer in a literal and spiritual torpor that is anything but cathartic . 
1 ||| that it'll probably be the best and most mature comedy of the 2002 summer season speaks more of the season than the picture
0 ||| the talented and clever robert rodriguez perhaps put a little too much heart into his first film and didn't reserve enough for his second . 
1 ||| this film is so different from the apple and so striking that it can only encourage us to see samira makhmalbaf as a very distinctive sensibility , working to develop her own film language with conspicuous success . 
1 ||| romantic comedy and dogme 95 filmmaking may seem odd bedfellows , but they turn out to be delightfully compatible here . 
1 ||| michael moore's latest documentary about america's thirst for violence is his best film yet . . . 
0 ||| as an actor , the rock is aptly named . 
0 ||| if anything , see it for karen black , who camps up a storm as a fringe feminist conspiracy theorist named dirty dick . 
0 ||| short and sweet , but also more than anything else slight� tadpole pulls back from the consequences of its own actions and revelations . 
0 ||| elicits more groans from the audience than jar jar binks , scrappy doo and scooby dumb , all wrapped up into one . 
0 ||| a puppy dog so desperate for attention it nearly breaks its little neck trying to perform entertaining tricks . 
1 ||| this remake gets all there is to get out of a peculiar premise with promise : al pacino loathing robin williams . 
1 ||| just what makes us happy , anyway ? 
1 ||| to those who have not read the book , the film is a much better mother-daughter tale than last summer's 'divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood , ' but that's not saying much . 
0 ||| 'how many more voyages can this limping but dearly-loved franchise survive ? '
0 ||| with spy kids 2 : the island of lost dreams writer/director/producer robert rodriguez has cobbled together a film that feels like a sugar high gone awry . 
1 ||| y tu mam� tambi�n es un buen filme gracias a lo poco convencional de su narrativa , y es quiz� el proyecto m�s arriesgado en la carrera de alfonso cuar�n
1 ||| with not a lot of help from the screenplay ( proficient , but singularly cursory ) , [testud] acts with the feral intensity of the young bette davis . 
0 ||| while easier to sit through than most of jaglom's self-conscious and gratingly irritating films , it's still tainted by cliches , painful improbability and murky points . 
0 ||| the movie wavers between hallmark card sentimentality and goofy , life-affirming moments straight out of a cellular phone commercial . 
1 ||| � uma pena que , mais tarde , o pr�prio filme abandone o tom de par�dia e passe a utilizar os mesmos clich�s que havia satirizado . 
0 ||| at no point during k-19 : the widowmaker did this viewer feel enveloped in a story that , though meant to be universal in its themes of loyalty , courage and dedication to a common goal , never seems to leave the lot . 
1 ||| quitting delivers a sucker-punch , and its impact is all the greater beause director zhang's last film , the cuddly shower , was a non-threatening multi-character piece centered around a public bath house . 
1 ||| remarkable for its intelligence and intensity . 
1 ||| the movie has an avalanche of eye-popping visual effects . 
0 ||| a muddy psychological thriller rife with miscalculations . it makes me say the obvious : abandon all hope of a good movie ye who enter here . 
1 ||| even when he's not at his most critically insightful , godard can still be smarter than any 50 other filmmakers still at work . 
1 ||| goyer's screenplay and direction are thankfully understated , and he has drawn excellent performances from his cast . 
1 ||| the movie enters a realm where few non-porn films venture , and comes across as darkly funny , energetic , and surprisingly gentle . 
0 ||| as violent , profane and exploitative as the most offensive action flick you've ever seen . 
1 ||| a pleasant enough romance with intellectual underpinnings , the kind of movie that entertains even as it turns maddeningly predictable . 
0 ||| releasing a film with the word 'dog' in its title in january lends itself to easy jokes and insults , and snow dogs deserves every single one of them . 
1 ||| writer/director alexander payne ( election ) and his co-writer jim taylor brilliantly employ their quirky and fearless ability to look american angst in the eye and end up laughing . 
1 ||| cut through the layers of soap-opera emotion and you find a scathing portrayal of a powerful entity strangling the life out of the people who want to believe in it the most . 
1 ||| not only is it a charming , funny and beautifully crafted import , it uses very little dialogue , making it relatively effortless to read and follow the action at the same time . 
1 |||  . . . a poignant and powerful narrative that reveals that reading writing and arithmetic are not the only subjects to learn in life . 
1 ||| grant gets to display his cadness to perfection , but also to show acting range that may surprise some who thought light-hearted comedy was his forte . 
1 ||| an incredibly thoughtful , deeply meditative picture that neatly and effectively captures the debilitating grief felt in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks . 
0 ||| frank capra played this story straight . but the 2002 film doesn't really believe in it , and breaks the mood with absurdly inappropriate 'comedy' scenes . 
1 ||| humorous and heartfelt , douglas mcgrath's version of 'nicholas nickleby' left me feeling refreshed and hopeful . not many movies have that kind of impact on me these days . 
0 ||| demme finally succeeds in diminishing his stature from oscar-winning master to lowly studio hack . 
1 ||| an incredibly low-rent danish film , it brings a group of people together in a sweet and charming way , if a little convenient
1 ||| as the dominant christine , sylvie testud is icily brilliant . 
0 ||| plays like one long , meandering sketch inspired by the works of john waters and todd solondz , rather than a fully developed story . 
1 ||| those who don't entirely 'get' godard's distinctive discourse will still come away with a sense of his reserved but existential poignancy . 
0 ||| the images are usually abbreviated in favor of mushy obviousness and telegraphed pathos , particularly where whitaker's misfit artist is concerned . 
1 ||| a strangely stirring experience that finds warmth in the coldest environment and makes each crumb of emotional comfort feel like a 10-course banquet . 
0 ||| eight legged freaks ? no big hairy deal . 
0 ||| to be oblivious to the existence of this film would be very sweet indeed . 
0 ||| a poky and pseudo-serious exercise in sham actor workshops and an affected malaise . 
1 ||| the plot of the comeback curlers isn't very interesting actually , but what i like about men with brooms and what is kind of special is how the film knows what's unique and quirky about canadians . 
0 ||| though it pretends to expose the life of male hustlers , it's exploitive without being insightful . 
0 ||| the film's center will not hold . 
1 ||| the premise of jason x is silly but strangely believable . 
0 ||| an authentically vague , but ultimately purposeless , study in total pandemonium . 
1 ||| by candidly detailing the politics involved in the creation of an extraordinary piece of music , [jones] calls our attention to the inherent conflict between commerce and creativity . 
0 ||| the first mistake , i suspect , is casting shatner as a legendary professor and kunis as a brilliant college student--where's pauly shore as the rocket scientist ? 
0 ||| though the book runs only about 300 pages , it is so densely packed . . . that even an ambitious adaptation and elaborate production like mr . schepisi's seems skimpy and unclear . 
0 ||| sweet home alabama certainly won't be remembered as one of [witherspoon's] better films . 
0 ||| schneidermeister . . . makin' a fool of himself . . . losin' his fan base . . . 
0 ||| novak contemplates a heartland so overwhelmed by its lack of purpose that it seeks excitement in manufactured high drama . 
1 ||| a gripping , searing portrait of a lost soul trying to find her way through life . 
0 ||| barely goes beyond comic book status . 
1 ||| there has been a string of ensemble cast romances recently . . . but peter mattei's love in the time of money sets itself apart by forming a chain of relationships that come full circle to end on a positive ( if tragic ) note . 
0 ||| with its dogged hollywood naturalism and the inexorable passage of its characters toward sainthood , windtalkers is nothing but a sticky-sweet soap . 
1 ||| the quirky and recessive charms of co-stars martin donovan and mary-louise parker help overcome the problematic script . 
0 ||| told in scattered fashion , the movie only intermittently lives up to the stories and faces and music of the men who are its subject . 
0 ||| when [reno] lets her radical flag fly , taking angry potshots at george w . bush , henry kissinger , larry king , et al . , reno devolves into a laugh-free lecture . 
0 ||| all of the filmmakers' calculations can't rescue brown sugar from the curse of blandness . 
1 ||| this cinema verite speculation on the assassination of john f . kennedy may have been inspired by blair witch , but it takes its techniques into such fresh territory that the film never feels derivative . 
1 ||| there's very little sense to what's going on here , but the makers serve up the cliches with considerable dash . 
1 ||| a brutally honest documentary about a much anticipated family reunion that goes wrong thanks to culture shock and a refusal to empathize with others . 
1 ||| though writer/director bart freundlich's film ultimately becomes a simplistic story about a dysfunctional parent-child relationship , it has some special qualities and the soulful gravity of crudup's anchoring performance . 
1 ||| offers a persuasive look at a defeated but defiant nation in flux . 
0 ||| as the movie dragged on , i thought i heard a mysterious voice , and felt myself powerfully drawn toward the light -- the light of the exit sign . i have returned from the beyond to warn you : this movie is 90 minutes long , and life is too short . 
0 ||| there is simply not enough of interest onscreen to sustain its seventy-minute running time . 
1 ||| the film's 45-minute running time stops shy of overkill , though viewers may be more exhausted than the athletes onscreen . 
1 ||| it's predictable , but it jumps through the expected hoops with style and even some depth . 
0 ||| chalk it up as the worst kind of hubristic folly . 
1 ||| [kline's] utterly convincing -- and deeply appealing -- as a noble teacher who embraces a strict moral code , and as a flawed human being who can't quite live up to it . 
1 ||| it's a good film -- not a classic , but odd , entertaining and authentic . 
0 ||| though her fans will assuredly have their funny bones tickled , others will find their humor-seeking dollars best spent elsewhere . 
0 ||| it's mired in a shabby script that piles layer upon layer of action man clich� atop wooden dialogue and a shifting tone that falls far short of the peculiarly moral amorality of [woo's] best work . 
0 ||| i hate this movie
0 ||| just how extreme are these ops ? i regret to report that these ops are just not extreme enough . 
0 ||| alternately frustrating and rewarding . 
1 ||| what makes esther kahn so demanding is that it progresses in such a low-key manner that it risks monotony . but it's worth the concentration . 
1 ||| eerily accurate depiction of depression . 
1 ||| it's plotless , shapeless -- and yet , it must be admitted , not entirely humorless . indeed , the more outrageous bits achieve a shock-you-into-laughter intensity of almost dadaist proportions . 
0 ||| it's a film that hinges on its casting , and glover really doesn't fit the part . 
1 ||| that the film opens with maggots crawling on a dead dog is not an out of place metaphor . 
1 ||| the seaside splendor and shallow , beautiful people are nice to look at while you wait for the story to get going . 
1 ||| while the story does seem pretty unbelievable at times , it's awfully entertaining to watch . 
0 ||| conforms itself with creating a game of 'who's who' . . . where the characters' moves are often more predictable than their consequences . 
1 ||| white oleander may leave you rolling your eyes in the dark , but that doesn't mean you won't like looking at it . 
0 ||| the hanukkah spirit seems fried in pork . 
1 ||| after making several adaptations of other writers' work , armenian-canadian director atom egoyan broached an original treatment of a deeply personal subject . 
0 ||| given too much time to consider the looseness of the piece , the picture begins to resemble the shapeless , grasping actors' workshop that it is . 
1 ||| mixes likeable personalities , inventive photography and cutting , and wall-to-wall toe-tapping music to paint a picture of a subculture that is at once exhilarating , silly , perverse , hopeful and always fun . 
0 ||| distances you by throwing out so many red herrings , so many false scares , that the genuine ones barely register . 
1 ||| pratfalls aside , barbershop gets its greatest play from the timeless spectacle of people really talking to each other . 
1 ||| the movie does its best to work us over , with second helpings of love , romance , tragedy , false dawns , real dawns , comic relief , two separate crises during marriage ceremonies , and the lush scenery of the cotswolds . 
0 ||| a movie that feels like the pilot episode of a new teen-targeted action tv series . 
1 ||| this one is strictly a lightweight escapist film . 
1 ||| those moviegoers who would automatically bypass a hip-hop documentary should give " scratch " a second look . 
1 ||| a gem , captured in the unhurried , low-key style favored by many directors of the iranian new wave . 
0 ||| places a slightly believable love triangle in a difficult-to-swallow setting , and then disappointingly moves the story into the realm of an improbable thriller . 
1 ||| it's a scattershot affair , but when it hits its mark it's brilliant . 
0 ||| an empty , purposeless exercise . 
1 ||| there are so few films about the plight of american indians in modern america that skins comes as a welcome , if downbeat , missive from a forgotten front . 
0 ||| the crassness of this reactionary thriller is matched only by the ridiculousness of its premise . 
1 ||| this charming , thought-provoking new york fest of life and love has its rewards . 
1 ||| once the downward spiral comes to pass , auto focus bears out as your typical junkie opera . . . 
0 ||| cloaks a familiar anti-feminist equation ( career - kids = misery ) in tiresome romantic-comedy duds . 
1 ||| all three actresses are simply dazzling , particularly balk , who's finally been given a part worthy of her considerable talents . 
0 ||| avary's film never quite emerges from the shadow of ellis' book . 
0 ||| a woefully dull , redundant concept that bears more than a whiff of exploitation , despite iwai's vaunted empathy . 
0 ||| a film that clearly means to preach exclusively to the converted . 
1 ||| its use of the thriller form to examine the labyrinthine ways in which people's lives cross and change , buffeted by events seemingly out of their control , is intriguing , provocative stuff . 
0 ||| the idea is more interesting than the screenplay , which lags badly in the middle and lurches between not-very-funny comedy , unconvincing dramatics and some last-minute action strongly reminiscent of run lola run . 
0 ||| maybe leblanc thought , " hey , the movie about the baseball-playing monkey was worse . " 
0 ||| a puzzle whose pieces do not fit . some are fascinating and others are not , and in the end , it is almost a good movie . 
1 ||| like the best 60 minutes expos� , the film ( at 80 minutes ) is actually quite entertaining . 
1 ||| a charming and funny story of clashing cultures and a clashing mother/daughter relationship . 
1 ||| rare is the 'urban comedy' that even attempts the insight and honesty of this disarming indie . 
0 ||| while the production details are lavish , film has little insight into the historical period and its artists , particularly in how sand developed a notorious reputation . 
0 ||| the notion that bombing buildings is the funniest thing in the world goes entirely unexamined in this startlingly unfunny comedy . 
0 ||| the film , like jimmy's routines , could use a few good laughs . 
1 ||| it took 19 predecessors to get this ? 
1 ||| holm . . . embodies the character with an effortlessly regal charisma . 
0 |||  . . . if it had been only half-an-hour long or a tv special , the humor would have been fast and furious-- at ninety minutes , it drags . 
1 ||| it's good to see michael caine whipping out the dirty words and punching people in the stomach again . 
1 ||| chicago pode at� ser um filme divertido e cativante ( como � ) , mas acaba representando um passo que vai na dire��o contr�ria � evolu��o dos musicais . 
1 ||| hatfield and hicks make the oddest of couples , and in this sense the movie becomes a study of the gambles of the publishing world , offering a case study that exists apart from all the movie's political ramifications . 
1 ||| the visuals alone make metropolis worth seeing . 
0 ||| the most ill-conceived animated comedy since the 1991 dog rover dangerfield . 
1 ||| marvelously entertaining and deliriously joyous documentary . 
1 ||| 'tobey maguire is a poster boy for the geek generation . '
1 ||| delivers the sexy razzle-dazzle that everyone , especially movie musical fans , has been hoping for . 
0 ||| even murphy's expert comic timing and famed charisma can't rescue this effort . 
0 ||| the lousy john q all but spits out denzel washington's fine performance in the title role . 
0 ||| a tired , unimaginative and derivative variation of that already-shallow genre . 
1 ||| it has a dashing and resourceful hero ; a lisping , reptilian villain ; big fights ; big hair ; lavish period scenery ; and a story just complicated enough to let you bask in your own cleverness as you figure it out . 
1 ||| as a revenge thriller , the movie is serviceable , but it doesn't really deliver the delicious guilty pleasure of the better film versions . 
0 ||| what little atmosphere is generated by the shadowy lighting , macabre sets , and endless rain is offset by the sheer ugliness of everything else . 
1 ||| after watching it , you can only love the players it brings to the fore for the gifted but no-nonsense human beings they are and for the still-inestimable contribution they have made to our shared history . 
0 ||| kids don't mind crappy movies as much as adults , provided there's lots of cute animals and clumsy people . 'snow dogs' has both . 
0 ||| 'unfaithful' cheats on itself and retreats to comfortable territory . too bad . 
1 ||| davis . . . gets vivid performances from her cast and pulls off some deft ally mcbeal-style fantasy sequences . 
0 ||| the script's judgment and sense of weight is way , way off . 
0 ||| all i can say is fuhgeddaboutit . 
0 ||| the plot is nothing but boilerplate clich�s from start to finish , and the script assumes that not only would subtlety be lost on the target audience , but that it's also too stupid to realize that they've already seen this exact same movie a hundred times
0 ||| imagine susan sontag falling in love with howard stern . 
1 ||| an absorbing trip into the minds and motivations of people under stress as well as a keen , unsentimental look at variations on the theme of motherhood . 
1 ||| don't wait to see this terrific film with your kids -- if you don't have kids borrow some . 
1 ||| those who love cinema paradiso will find the new scenes interesting , but few will find the movie improved . 
1 ||| although estela bravo's documentary is cloyingly hagiographic in its portrait of cuban leader fidel castro , it's still a guilty pleasure to watch . 
0 |||  . . . an airless , prepackaged julia roberts wannabe that stinks so badly of hard-sell image-mongering you'll wonder if lopez's publicist should share screenwriting credit . 
0 ||| eight legged freaks falls flat as a spoof . 
0 ||| even as lame horror flicks go , this is lame . 
1 ||| a coming-of-age tale from new zealand whose boozy , languid air is balanced by a rich visual clarity and deeply felt performances across the board . 
1 ||| a gripping drama . 
0 ||| epps has neither the charisma nor the natural affability that has made tucker a star . 
1 ||| that rara avis : the intelligent romantic comedy with actual ideas on its mind . 
1 ||| far more successful , if considerably less ambitious , than last year's kubrick-meets-spielberg exercise . 
1 ||| funny and also heartwarming without stooping to gooeyness . 
0 ||| the premise for this kegger comedy probably sounded brilliant four six-packs and a pitcher of margaritas in , but the film must have been written . . . in the thrall of a vicious hangover . 
1 ||| the real triumphs in igby come from philippe , who makes oliver far more interesting than the character's lines would suggest , and sarandon , who couldn't be better as a cruel but weirdly likable wasp matron . 
0 ||| reggio and glass so rhapsodize cynicism , with repetition and languorous slo-mo sequences , that glass's dirgelike score becomes a fang-baring lullaby . 
0 ||| the big-screen scooby makes the silly original cartoon seem smart and well-crafted in comparison . 
1 ||| well-written , nicely acted and beautifully shot and scored , the film works on several levels , openly questioning social mores while ensnaring the audience with its emotional pull . 
1 ||| those who would follow haneke on his creepy explorations . . . are rewarded by brutal , committed performances from huppert and magimel . 
1 ||| ms . hutchins is talented enough and charismatic enough to make us care about zelda's ultimate fate . 
0 ||| brady achieves the remarkable feat of squandering a topnotch foursome of actors . . . by shoving them into every clich�d white-trash situation imaginable . 
0 ||| detox is ultimately a pointless endeavor . 
0 ||| the emperor's club is one of those films that possesses all the good intentions in the world , but . . . 
1 ||| a solid , psychological action film from hong kong . 
0 ||| dripping with cliche and bypassing no opportunity to trivialize the material . 
0 ||| like a can of 2-day old coke . you can taste it , but there's no fizz . 
1 ||| a film that is a portrait of grace in an imperfect world . 
0 ||| the acting is just fine , but there's not enough substance here to sustain interest for the full 90 minutes , especially with the weak payoff . 
0 ||| seagal ran out of movies years ago , and this is just the proof . 
0 ||| seagal is painfully foolish in trying to hold onto what's left of his passe' chopsocky glory . 
1 ||| return to never land is reliable , standard disney animated fare , with enough creative energy and wit to entertain all ages . 
0 ||| the title , alone , should scare any sane person away . 
0 ||| in his determination to lighten the heavy subject matter , silberling also , to a certain extent , trivializes the movie with too many nervous gags and pratfalls . 
0 ||| writer-director ritchie reduces wertmuller's social mores and politics to tiresome jargon . 
0 ||| a rather tired exercise in nostalgia . 
1 ||| by turns touching , raucously amusing , uncomfortable , and , yes , even sexy , never again is a welcome and heartwarming addition to the romantic comedy genre . 
1 ||| a sly female empowerment movie , although not in a way anyone would expect . 
1 ||| for those who are intrigued by politics of the '70s , the film is every bit as fascinating as it is flawed . 
1 ||| <em>ash wednesday</em> is not edward burns' best film , but it is a good and ambitious film . and it marks him as one of the most interesting writer/directors working today . 
1 ||| may take its sweet time to get wherever it's going , but if you have the patience for it , you won't feel like it's wasted yours . 
0 ||| offers absolutely nothing i hadn't already seen . 
1 ||| a woman's pic directed with resonance by ilya chaiken . 
1 ||| peppering this urban study with references to norwegian folktales , villeneuve creates in maelstrom a world where the bizarre is credible and the real turns magical . 
1 ||| somehow ms . griffiths and mr . pryce bring off this wild welsh whimsy . 
1 ||| the formula is familiar but enjoyable . 
0 ||| it has the air of a surprisingly juvenile lark , a pop-influenced prank whose charms are immediately apparent and wear thin with repetition . 
0 ||| winds up feeling like lots of other quirky movies that try to score hipness points with young adults . 
0 ||| this ill-fitting tuxedo is strictly off-the-rack . 
0 ||| what we get in feardotcom is more like something from a bad clive barker movie . in other words , it's badder than bad . 
0 ||| when the screenwriter responsible for one of the worst movies of one year directs an equally miserable film the following year , you'd have a hard time believing it was just coincidence . 
0 ||| cherish is a dud -- a romantic comedy that's not the least bit romantic and only mildly funny . 
0 ||| there is not an ounce of honesty in the entire production . 
1 ||| anyone who ever fantasized about space travel but can't afford the $20 million ticket to ride a russian rocket should catch this imax offering . 
1 ||| the passions aroused by the discord between old and new cultures are set against the strange , stark beauty of the mideast desert , so lovingly and perceptively filmed that you can almost taste the desiccated air . 
1 ||| what " empire " lacks in depth it makes up for with its heart . 
1 ||| while general audiences might not come away with a greater knowledge of the facts of cuban music , they'll be treated to an impressive and highly entertaining celebration of its sounds . 
0 ||| it will come as no surprise that the movie isn't scary . but here's the real damn : it isn't funny , either . 
0 |||  . . . the last time i saw a theater full of people constantly checking their watches was during my sats . 
1 ||| still rapturous after all these years , cinema paradiso stands as one of the great films about movie love . 
1 |||  . . . a visually seductive , unrepentantly trashy take on rice's second installment of her vampire chronicles . 
1 ||| diverting french comedy in which a husband has to cope with the pesky moods of jealousy . 
0 ||| one of the more glaring signs of this movie's servitude to its superstar is the way it skirts around any scenes that might have required genuine acting from ms . spears . 
1 ||| you live the mood rather than savour the story . 
0 ||| ill-considered , unholy hokum . 
1 ||| as averse as i usually am to feel-good , follow-your-dream hollywood fantasies , this one got to me . 
1 ||| apart from its own considerable achievement , metropolis confirms tezuka's status as both the primary visual influence on the anim� tradition and its defining philosophical conscience . 
1 ||| an artful , intelligent film that stays within the confines of a well-established genre . 
1 ||| who knows what exactly godard is on about in this film , but his words and images don't have to add up to mesmerize you . 
1 ||| a journey through memory , a celebration of living , and a sobering rumination on fatality , classism , and ignorance . 
1 ||| a spunky , original take on a theme that will resonate with singles of many ages . 
0 ||| sandra bullock , despite downplaying her good looks , carries a little too much ain't- she-cute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff . 
1 ||| an amused indictment of jaglom's own profession . 
1 ||| despite the film's shortcomings , the stories are quietly moving . 
1 ||| a funny , triumphant , and moving documentary . 
0 ||| my precious new star wars movie is a lumbering , wheezy drag . . . 
0 ||| after the setup , the air leaks out of the movie , flattening its momentum with about an hour to go . 
0 ||| for a movie about the power of poetry and passion , there is precious little of either . 
0 ||| a soggy , shapeless mess . . . just a dumb excuse for a waterlogged equivalent of a haunted-house movie . 
1 ||| two weeks notice has appeal beyond being a sandra bullock vehicle or a standard romantic comedy . 
1 ||| ray liotta and jason patric do some of their best work in their underwritten roles , but don't be fooled : nobody deserves any prizes here . 
1 ||| these three films form a remarkably cohesive whole , both visually and thematically , through their consistently sensitive and often exciting treatment of an ignored people . 
1 ||| as improbable as this premise may seem , abbass's understated , shining performance offers us the sense that on some elemental level , lilia deeply wants to break free of her old life . 
0 ||| now here's a sadistic bike flick that would have made vittorio de sica proud . 
0 ||| a feel-good movie that doesn't give you enough to feel good about . 
0 ||| this director's cut -- which adds 51 minutes -- takes a great film and turns it into a mundane soap opera . 
0 ||| in comparison to his earlier films it seems a disappointingly thin slice of lower-class london life ; despite the title . . . amounts to surprisingly little . 
1 ||| for those in search of something different , wendigo is a genuinely bone-chilling tale . 
1 ||| the terrific and bewilderingly underrated campbell scott gives a star performance that is nothing short of mesmerizing . 
0 ||| if there's a heaven for bad movies , deuces wild is on its way . 
1 ||| it's a bit disappointing that it only manages to be decent instead of dead brilliant . 
0 ||| solaris " is a shapeless inconsequential move relying on the viewer to do most of the work . 
1 ||| the attraction between these two marginal characters is complex from the start -- and , refreshingly , stays that way . 
1 ||| westfeldt and juergensen exude a chemistry and comfort level that's both saucy and endearing . 
1 ||| tsai ming-liang has taken his trademark style and refined it to a crystalline point . 
0 ||| those 24-and-unders looking for their own caddyshack to adopt as a generational signpost may have to keep on looking . 
1 ||| it has a way of seeping into your consciousness , with lingering questions about what the film is really getting at . 
1 ||| like these russo guys lookin' for their mamet instead found their sturges . 
1 ||| although commentary on nachtwey is provided . . . it's the image that really tells the tale . 
0 ||| not that any of us should be complaining when a film clocks in around 90 minutes these days , but the plotting here leaves a lot to be desired . 
0 ||| what was once original has been co-opted so frequently that it now seems pedestrian . 
0 ||| in a big corner office in hell , satan is throwing up his hands in surrender , is firing his r&d people , and has decided he will just screen the master of disguise 24/7 . 
0 ||| marries the amateurishness of the blair witch project with the illogic of series 7 : the contenders to create a completely crass and forgettable movie . 
0 ||| much of the cast is stiff or just plain bad . 
0 ||| and if you appreciate the one-sided theme to lawrence's over-indulgent tirade , then knock yourself out and enjoy the big screen postcard that is a self-glorified martin lawrence lovefest . if you are willing to do this , then you so crazy ! 
1 ||| dazzling and sugar-sweet , a blast of shallow magnificence that only sex , scandal , and a chorus line of dangerous damsels can deliver . 
1 ||| works because reno doesn't become smug or sanctimonious towards the audience . 
0 ||| after collateral damage , you might imagine that most every aggrieved father clich� has been unturned . but no . 
1 ||| you'll get the enjoyable basic minimum . but not a whit more . 
1 ||| while this film is not in the least surprising , it is still ultimately very satisfying . think of it as a sort of comfort food for the mind . 
1 ||| one of the more intelligent children's movies to hit theaters this year . 
1 ||| film can't quite maintain its initial momentum , but remains sporadically funny throughout . 
1 ||| it's up to you to decide whether to admire these people's dedication to their cause or be repelled by their dogmatism , manipulativeness and narrow , fearful view of american life . 
0 ||| hilarious musical comedy though stymied by accents thick as mud . 
0 ||| suffers from a decided lack of creative storytelling . 
0 ||| the animation is competent , and some of the gags are quite funny , but jonah . . . never shakes the oppressive , morally superior good-for-you quality that almost automatically accompanies didactic entertainment . 
1 ||| cool gadgets and creatures keep this fresh . not as good as the original , but what is . . . 
1 ||| provides a porthole into that noble , trembling incoherence that defines us all . 
1 ||| collateral damage finally delivers the goods for schwarzenegger fans . 
1 ||| deflated ending aside , there's much to recommend the film . 
0 ||| a cleverly crafted but ultimately hollow mockumentary . 
0 ||| has its charming quirks and its dull spots . 
0 ||| eastwood winces , clutches his chest and gasps for breath . it's a spectacular performance - ahem , we hope it's only acting . 
1 ||| an exceedingly clever piece of cinema . another great �what you don't see' is much more terrifying than what you do see thriller , coupled with some arresting effects , incandescent tones and stupendous performances
1 ||| an intelligent and deeply felt work about impossible , irrevocable choices and the price of making them . 
0 ||| a baffling subplot involving smuggling drugs inside danish cows falls flat , and if you're going to alter the bard's ending , you'd better have a good alternative . 
1 |||  . . . the one thing this wild film has that other imax films don't : chimps , lots of chimps , all blown up to the size of a house . that's fun for kids of any age . 
1 ||| the filmmakers try to balance pointed , often incisive satire and unabashed sweetness , with results that are sometimes bracing , sometimes baffling and quite often , and in unexpected ways , touching . 
0 ||| going to the website may be just as fun ( and scary ) as going to the film . 
1 ||| a perverse little truffle , dainty psychological terror on the outside with a creamy filling of familial jealousy and unrepentant domestic psychopathy . 
1 |||  . . . manages to deliver a fair bit of vampire fun . 
0 ||| a formula family tearjerker told with a heavy irish brogue . . . accentuating , rather than muting , the plot's saccharine thrust . 
0 ||| should have been worth cheering as a breakthrough but is devoid of wit and humor . 
1 ||| drumline ably captures the complicated relationships in a marching band . 
0 ||| it's a bad thing when a movie has about as much substance as its end credits blooper reel . 
1 ||| even through its flaws , revolution #9 proves to be a compelling , interestingly told film . 
1 ||| touches smartly and wistfully on a number of themes , not least the notion that the marginal members of society . . . might benefit from a helping hand and a friendly kick in the pants . 
0 ||| bisset delivers a game performance , but she is unable to save the movie . 
1 ||| a hidden-agenda drama that shouts classic french nuance . 
0 ||| poor ben bratt couldn't find stardom if mapquest emailed him point-to-point driving directions . 
0 ||| under-rehearsed and lifeless
1 ||| i prefer soderbergh's concentration on his two lovers over tarkovsky's mostly male , mostly patriarchal debating societies . 
1 ||| the paradiso's rusted-out ruin and ultimate collapse during the film's final ( restored ) third�emotionally belittle a cinema classic . sometimes shorter is better . 
1 ||| slow and ponderous , but rohmer's drama builds to an intense indoor drama about compassion , sacrifice , and christian love in the face of political corruption . 
0 ||| the movie is so contrived , nonsensical and formulaic that , come to think of it , the day-old shelf would be a more appropriate location to store it . 
1 ||| underachieves only in not taking the shakespeare parallels quite far enough . 
0 ||| big fat liar is just futile silliness looking to tap into the kiddie sensibilities . 
1 ||| it's endearing to hear madame d . refer to her husband as 'jackie' -- and he does make for excellent company , not least as a self-conscious performer . 
1 ||| this chicago has hugely imaginative and successful casting to its great credit , as well as one terrific score and attitude to spare . 
0 ||| its inescapable absurdities are tantamount to insulting the intelligence of anyone who hasn't been living under a rock ( since sept . 11 ) . 
0 ||| it takes a really long , slow and dreary time to dope out what tuck everlasting is about . so here it is : it's about a family of sour immortals . 
1 ||| there are moments in this account of the life of artist frida kahlo that are among cinema's finest this year . unfortunately , they're sandwiched in between the most impossibly dry account of kahlo's life imaginable . 
0 ||| instead of accurately accounting a terrible true story , the film's more determined to become the next texas chainsaw massacre . but what about the countless other people who'd merely like to watch a solid tale about a universally interesting soul ? 
0 ||| 'wouldn't it be nice if all guys got a taste of what it's like on the other side of the bra ? '
1 ||| twohy's a good yarn-spinner , and ultimately the story compels . 
0 ||| every bit as bogus as most disney live action family movies are -- no real plot , no real conflict , no real point . 
0 ||| k-19 exploits our substantial collective fear of nuclear holocaust to generate cheap hollywood tension . 
0 ||| it would be great to see this turd squashed under a truck , preferably a semi . 
0 ||| this hastily mounted production exists only to capitalize on hopkins' inclination to play hannibal lecter again , even though harris has no immediate inclination to provide a fourth book . 
1 ||| by the time we learn that andrew's turnabout is fair play is every bit as awful as borchardt's coven , we can enjoy it anyway . 
1 ||| the movie is a blast of educational energy , as bouncy animation and catchy songs escort you through the entire 85 minutes . 
1 ||| a potent allegorical love story . 
1 ||| for those who pride themselves on sophisticated , discerning taste , this might not seem like the proper cup of tea , however it is almost guaranteed that even the stuffiest cinema goers will laugh their * * * off for an hour-and-a-half . 
0 ||| complex , sinuously plotted and , somehow , off-puttingly cold . 
0 ||| while it's genuinely cool to hear characters talk about early rap records ( sugar hill gang , etc . ) , the constant referencing of hip-hop arcana can alienate even the savviest audiences . 
1 ||| the result is more depressing than liberating , but it's never boring . 
0 ||| the script is a disaster , with cloying messages and irksome characters . 
0 ||| the 50-something lovebirds are too immature and unappealing to care about . 
1 ||| the underworld urban angst is derivative of martin scorsese's taxi driver and goodfellas , but this film speaks for itself . 
1 ||| gondry's direction is adequate . . . but what gives human nature its unique feel is kaufman's script . 
0 ||| execrable . 
0 ||| a manipulative feminist empowerment tale thinly posing as a serious drama about spousal abuse . 
1 ||| beautifully produced . 
1 ||| when compared to the usual , more somber festival entries , davis' highly personal brand of romantic comedy is a tart , smart breath of fresh air that stands out from the pack even if the picture itself is somewhat problematic . 
1 ||| maid in manhattan might not look so appealing on third or fourth viewing down the road . . . but as a high concept vehicle for two bright stars of the moment who can rise to fans' lofty expectations , the movie passes inspection . 
1 ||| it's a refreshing change from the self-interest and paranoia that shape most american representations of castro . 
0 ||| if you think that jennifer lopez has shown poor judgment in planning to marry ben affleck , wait till you see maid in manhattan . 
0 ||| shunji iwai's all about lily chou chou is a beautifully shot , but ultimately flawed film about growing up in japan . 
0 |||  . . . if you , like me , think an action film disguised as a war tribute is disgusting to begin with , then you're in for a painful ride . 
1 |||  . . . a story , an old and scary one , about the monsters we make , and the vengeance they take . 
0 ||| at once half-baked and overheated . 
0 ||| it's not a particularly good film , but neither is it a monsterous one . 
1 ||| has a plot full of twists upon knots . . . and a nonstop parade of mock-tarantino scuzbag types that starts out clever but veers into overkill . 
1 ||| a plethora of engaging diatribes on the meaning of 'home , ' delivered in grand passion by the members of the various households . 
0 ||| possession is in the end an honorable , interesting failure . it falls far short of poetry , but it's not bad prose . 
1 ||| a literary detective story is still a detective story and aficionados of the whodunit won't be disappointed . 
0 ||| ordinary melodrama that is heavy on religious symbols but wafer-thin on dramatic substance
0 ||| there's something unintentionally comic in the film's drumbeat about authenticity , given the stale plot and pornographic way the film revels in swank apartments , clothes and parties . 
0 ||| nothing about the film -- with the possible exception of elizabeth hurley's breasts -- is authentic . 
0 ||| schnitzler's film has a great hook , some clever bits and well-drawn , if standard issue , characters , but is still only partly satisfying . 
1 ||| i admired this work a lot . 
1 ||| [the digital effects] reminded me of terry gilliam's rudimentary old monty python cartoons , in which he would cut out figures from drawings and photographs and paste them together . 
0 ||| scene-by-scene , things happen , but you'd be hard-pressed to say what or why . 
1 ||| led by griffin's smartly nuanced performance and enthusiasm , the cast has a lot of fun with the material . 
0 ||| more a gunfest than a rock concert . 
1 ||| if signs is a good film , and it is , the essence of a great one is in there somewhere . 
1 ||| a quiet family drama with a little bit of romance and a dose of darkness . 
0 ||| if you're really renting this you're not interested in discretion in your entertainment choices , you're interested in anne geddes , john grisham , and thomas kincaid . 
0 ||| judd's characters ought to pick up the durable best seller smart women , foolish choices for advice . 
1 ||| one can't deny its seriousness and quality . 
1 ||| 'compleja e intelectualmente retadora , el ladr�n de orqu�deas es uno de esos filmes que vale la pena ver precisamente por su originalidad . '
0 ||| the stupidest , most insulting movie of 2002's first quarter . 
0 ||| a recipe for cinematic disaster . . . part quentin tarantino , part guy ritchie , and part 1960s spy spoof , it's all bad . 
1 ||| the film's desire to be liked sometimes undermines the possibility for an exploration of the thornier aspects of the nature/nurture argument in regards to homosexuality . 
1 ||| there are just enough twists in the tale to make it far more satisfying than almost any horror film in recent memory . 
1 ||| although the film boils down to a lightweight story about matchmaking , the characters make italian for beginners worth the journey
0 ||| the average local news columnist has a bigger rant on the war between modern landscape architecture and small-town america . 
0 ||| when it comes to entertainment , children deserve better than pokemon 4ever . 
0 ||| for all of the contemporary post-colonialist consciousness that kapur tries to bring to the four feathers , the oddest thing about the movie is how it winds up affirming the same damn moldy values the material has always held dear . 
1 ||| the engagingly primitive animated special effects contribute to a mood that's sustained through the surprisingly somber conclusion . 
1 ||| by turns gripping , amusing , tender and heart-wrenching , laissez-passer has all the earmarks of french cinema at its best . 
1 ||| a good film with a solid pedigree both in front of and , more specifically , behind the camera . 
0 ||| the tug-of-war at the core of beijing bicycle becomes weighed down with agonizing contrivances , overheated pathos and long , wistful gazes . 
1 ||| not for everyone , but for those with whom it will connect , it's a nice departure from standard moviegoing fare . 
1 |||  . . . a series of tales told with the intricate preciseness of the best short story writing . 
1 ||| tony gayton's script doesn't give us anything we haven't seen before , but director d . j . caruso's grimy visual veneer and kilmer's absorbing performance increase the gravitational pull considerably . 
1 ||| so fiendishly cunning that even the most jaded cinema audiences will leave the auditorium feeling dizzy , confused , and totally disorientated . not to mention absolutely refreshed . 
1 ||| assured , vital and well wrought , the film is , arguably , the most accomplished work to date from hong kong's versatile stanley kwan . 
1 ||| an exhilarating serving of movie fluff . 
1 ||| connoisseurs of chinese film will be pleased to discover that tian's meticulous talent has not withered during his enforced hiatus . 
0 ||| remember back when thrillers actually thrilled ? when the twist endings were actually surprising ? when the violence actually shocked ? when the heroes were actually under 40 ? sadly , as blood work proves , that was a long , long time ago . 
1 ||| you won't like roger , but you will quickly recognize him . and that's a big part of why we go to the movies . 
1 ||| i'm not a fan of the phrase 'life affirming' because it usually means 'schmaltzy , ' but real women have curves truly is life affirming . 
0 ||| this latest installment of the horror film franchise that is apparently as invulnerable as its trademark villain has arrived for an incongruous summer playoff , demonstrating yet again that the era of the intelligent , well-made b movie is long gone . 
1 ||| this tenth feature is a big deal , indeed -- at least the third-best , and maybe even a notch above the previous runner-up , nicholas meyer's star trek vi : the undiscovered country . 
0 ||| there's an admirable rigor to jimmy's relentless anger , and to the script's refusal of a happy ending , but as those monologues stretch on and on , you realize there's no place for this story to go but down . 
1 ||| 'almod�var logra un filme entra�able , lleno de compasi�n , comprensi�n , amor , amistad , esperanza y humanidad que es sencillamente inolvidable . '
0 ||| national lampoon's van wilder may aim to be the next animal house , but it more closely resembles this year's version of tomcats . 
0 ||| strong setup and ambitious goals fade as the film descends into unsophisticated scare tactics and b-film thuggery . 
0 ||| this is the kind of movie that gets a quick release before real contenders arrive in september . 
1 ||| you might want to take a reality check before you pay the full ticket price to see " simone , " and consider a dvd rental instead . 
1 ||| a gentle and engrossing character study . 
0 ||| once [kim] begins to overplay the shock tactics and bait-and-tackle metaphors , you may decide it's too high a price to pay for a shimmering picture postcard . 
0 ||| complete lack of originality , cleverness or even visible effort
1 ||| an unsettling , memorable cinematic experience that does its predecessors proud . 
1 ||| charles' entertaining film chronicles seinfeld's return to stand-up comedy after the wrap of his legendary sitcom , alongside wannabe comic adams' attempts to get his shot at the big time . 
0 ||| empire can't make up its mind whether it wants to be a gangster flick or an art film . it doesn't work as either . 
0 ||| richard pryor mined his personal horrors and came up with a treasure chest of material , but lawrence gives us mostly fool's gold . 
0 ||| indifferently implausible popcorn programmer of a movie . 
1 ||| fast and funny , an action cartoon that's suspenseful enough for older kids but not too scary for the school-age crowd . 
1 ||| the people in jessica are so recognizable and true that , as in real life , we're never sure how things will work out . 
0 ||| what an embarrassment . 
1 ||| an undeniably moving film to experience , and ultimately that's what makes it worth a recommendation . 
1 ||| one of the year's best films , featuring an oscar-worthy performance by julianne moore . 
1 ||| [a] devastatingly powerful and astonishingly vivid holocaust drama . 
0 ||| mctiernan's remake may be lighter on its feet -- the sober-minded original was as graceful as a tap-dancing rhino -- but it is just as boring and as obvious . 
0 ||| more whiny downer than corruscating commentary .
